<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>STUDENTS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a splendid broadcasting station
at the Tech, Bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it; hence my general exuberance. And
if we don&#8217;t get at it once in a while, it&#8217;ll be because
we can&#8217;t break in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to shout into it first off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought you knew, Gus. I&#8217;ve got it all
fixed, date and time, for Professor Gray and Mr.
Hooper to listen in. They&#8217;re the chaps that are
responsible for our getting into the Tech and they
deserve our first message. I&#8217;ll explain to President
Field and I know he won&#8217;t object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this you were telling me about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
hazing?&#8221; asked Gus, but as though really little
interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Terry Watkins was telling me; his cousin went
there. Lost a new hat the third day, a pair of
glasses the fourth and most of his clothes the
fifth. His dad has a lot of dough, so he needn&#8217;t
have minded, but that won&#8217;t be the case with us.
I guess it&#8217;s me for carrying a gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re mean enough to pick on you, old
scout, I&#8217;ll carry one, too, but I think you&#8217;ll be
exempt. If I&#8217;m to be a victim, I reckon I&#8217;ll have
to grin and take&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you won&#8217;t, either. We&#8217;ve come here to
study&mdash;not to fool&mdash;and we haven&#8217;t got money to
spend on ruined duds just to gratify a lot of
chumps. There are better things, too, than a gun;
not so crude and not illegal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can imagine,&#8221; laughed Gus, and turned again
to watch the fleeting landscape.
</p>
<p>The chums journeyed in silence then, their
minds busy conjecturing what their experiences
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and adventures were to be, after they became
students of the Marshallton Technical School,
which they were rapidly approaching and from
which they held high hopes of gaining much knowledge.
The institution, despite its modest name,
was nothing less than a university of broad constructive
teaching, with departments of engineering,
electricity, chemistry, manual training and
biology.
</p>
<p>It was within the first two of these departments
that William Brown and Augustus Grier were to
concentrate their mental efforts. They had, as
already related, earned this long-hoped-for opportunity
to gain technical knowledge and training
by showing what they could do along these lines.
They had installed a small water-power plant and
an electric lighting system for the Hooper estate,
and had also won greater credit for constructing
high-class radio receivers through which they had
heard a no less personage than Thomas A. Edison
speak. The boys had been saving their earnings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
to meet tech school expenses for at least a year.
Their high school records, good common sense and
scientific inclinations had been such as to receive
the plaudits of their teacher, Professor Gray, and
the members of their class.
</p>
<p>Intense application and mental force characterized
William Brown, who was called &#8220;Billy&#8221; by
the high school girls&mdash;fine, bright-minded young
women&mdash;and &#8220;Bill&#8221; by the boys. He was just
Bill to nearly everyone. His friends referred to
him as the school genius; and such he had proved
to be on more than one occasion. Though compelled
by a twisted leg to use a crutch and to
abstain from strenuous physical participation in
sports, he was a favorite. All saw his worth, and
Professor Gray said of him that he possessed the
mind of a philosopher and the expressiveness of a
poet.
</p>
<p>Cheerful, delighting in the strength of others,
Bill&#8217;s natural love of friendly contests and admiration
for physical prowess impelled him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
adopt as his best chum Gus Grier, who had much
in common with him concerning mechanical matters.
Gus was in many things almost the exact
counterpart of the lame boy.
</p>
<p>Gus was bright, shrewd, practical, reticent. He
had the sort of mentality that made him a good
follower, with enough native wit to discover his
own limitations and to acknowledge Bill&#8217;s superior
characteristics. Both displayed that loyalty of
friendship whose rare quality has made notable
history. Sometimes their classmates called the
boys David and Jonathan, or Damon and Pythias;
sometimes, the head and body, the former referring
to Bill and the latter, with no less admiration,
to Gus because of his splendid athletic ability.
The muscles of Gus were quite as remarkable in
their way as Bill&#8217;s brains; and both boys were
modest, aiding one another in every time of need,
doubling all their efforts with the term &#8220;we,&#8221;
which Bill used oftenest.
</p>
<p>If Bill mastered a mental problem it was: &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
did it by this method.&#8221; If Gus entered upon a
trial of strength or physical skill it was: &#8220;We&#8217;ll
do our best,&#8221; and then: &#8220;Well, we won, but it was
no cinch&#8221;&mdash;in deference to the efforts of a beaten
opponent. All this was a matter of course. And
now, regarding the present, either friend might
have said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve passed our exams and we&#8217;re
going to Tech.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guilford! Guilford! All out for Marshallton!&#8221;
shouted the brakeman, and in half a minute
the boys were climbing into a taxi bound for the
school; in half an hour they were facing the great
buildings which stood for so much learning, and
in half a day they had matriculated and were of
the student body.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>FOOLED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Come here quick and watch this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? I&#8217;ve got this letter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is some livelier than letter writing, Bill,&#8221;
Gus declared, and a moment later Bill was of the
same mind.
</p>
<p>The boys gazed out of the window of their room
in the school dormitory to witness an upper-class
reception of one of the freshmen, a lad of almost
tender years, yet husky and of undoubted good
nature. He was expensively dressed to begin
with, a little foppish in appearance even, and it
was known that his people were very wealthy.
Such as he, then, could well afford the sacrifice
demanded of him to become a member in high
standing of the Marshallton student body. Whatever
was done, short of actual physical injury,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
must contribute to the violently initiated youth&#8217;s
general glorification, at least this was the popular
impression. It occurred to but few to make serious
objections to that which was customary in the
school.
</p>
<p>Hazing, long since taboo or forbidden in many
educational institutions, was still a part of Marshallton
Tech, by reason of the belief that a high
mentality and virile spirit demanded the extreme
mental and physical show-down which hazing is
wrongly supposed to bring out. Though severe
enough, perhaps the initiations were not so terrible
as to call for much complaint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By cracky, that&#8217;s rotten!&#8221; exclaimed Gus, as
he watched the progress of the affair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than mean!&#8221; agreed Bill.
</p>
<p>This comment was called forth as the victim, in
his efforts to escape from his tormentors, had his
coat and vest torn from him. In a little time his
shirt was reduced to ribbons. A fine gold watch
and its broken chain lay on the ground among the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
feet of the struggling boys, and an unsuspecting
heel soon reduced the time-piece to little more
value than the metal in the case. A wallet slid out
of a pocket and disgorged from its folds considerable
cash and paper, some of which the bystanders
gathered up with much difficulty. The freshman&#8217;s
panama, kicked about in the dust, was not rescued
until it resembled an uprooted weed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t enjoy being treated that way,&#8221;
commented Gus, the sentimental.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; amended Bill, the
practical. &#8220;That sort of thing may be well enough
for rich fellows, though I think it&#8217;s rank foolishness
at any time. But, Gus, we&#8217;ve got to dodge it
in some way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus made no reply. He was thinking that his
chum was right, but, still interested in the excitement
without, he left the usual whatever-it-must-be
with Bill. When Bill spoke again, some few
minutes after the well-hazed youth had made a
get-away, Gus listened with interest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can get the materials,&#8221; Bill finished, &#8220;and
it won&#8217;t take long to do the work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And it did not. Having procured a permit from
the professor of physics&mdash;and no one could have
refused Bill with his convincing tongue&mdash;the boys
returned well loaded to their room. They took
from a paper packing box, whose contents had
been hidden from the curious, a lot of wire, some
switches, some acid and a number of storage
battery cells.
</p>
<p>On their way from the central building the
chums had been stopped by a number of upper
classmen. It was mid-afternoon, an optional study
or playtime, and just the hour for brewing mischief.
This is what happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on there, Freeporters! Put down those
boxes; we have a little business to transact with
you,&#8221; the spokesman called.
</p>
<p>Gus gazed calmly at the five militant youths in
front of him. Without undue egotism, he possessed
an easy confidence, and he knew that, barring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
some bumps and scratches, that bunch would
need assistance in hazing him. He would have
complied forthwith, had not Bill given an ultimatum.
With a small box under his left arm, he
shifted his crutch to his left fingers and slipped
the free hand into his pocket, drawing forth about
the wickedest-looking pistol that any thug would
use. The five began backing away, the spokesman
turning quite pale and the others, no doubt, feeling
much as he looked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you Indians want to haze me?&#8221; Bill
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, no. You&#8217;re exempt, of course. We don&#8217;t
bother with cripples, kids, old ladies nor natural
criminals.&#8221; This attempt to be witty trailed off
weakly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my friend here is carrying glass and we
can&#8217;t tarry now. Any interference with him will
result in my turning criminal instanter, and I&#8217;m
keen to do so. Go on, Gus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus went on, and Bill, with weapon still in hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
followed after. He turned to call back to the
flabbergasted five:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find us in our room any time after
to-day. Getting hazed is really great sport, and
we won&#8217;t pull any guns on you then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hardly half an hour elapsed before there came
a knock at the door of the room occupied by Bill
and Gus. A moment before, Gus had been down
to get a pair of pliers that had dropped out of the
window and two wide-eyed lads in the hallway
had hailed him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That crutch-thumper that rooms with you is
in for the G. B.,&#8221; one had said and the other had
added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, he must be a blamed fool to carry a gun
and pull it here. &#8216;Prex&#8217; won&#8217;t stand for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill called a &#8220;Come in&#8221; in answer to the knock,
and no less than President Field and Professor
Whitcomb, both looking very stern, entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brown and Grier, I have heard with real pain
and very great surprise, after the letter from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Professor Gray highly recommending you two
lads, that you have so soon shown utter disregard
for the rules, the standing, the decency of our
institution by carrying and drawing a deadly
weapon, a pistol, and on slight provocation. This
is deserving of instant expul&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure is, Doctor Field, if it were so. But it
isn&#8217;t. And please, also, do not hold the idea that
it was on slight provocation. They were going to
haze us, or rather Gus here, Doctor. We had just
seen something of this sort, with the result that
Fleming, of Chicago, had a ruined suit and
panama, a fine watch destroyed, and a lot of money
and papers probably lost. We came here to study;
our means are limited; if we met with such a
disaster our finances wouldn&#8217;t stand it and we&#8217;d
have to go home; that&#8217;s all there is to it. Now, I
can&#8217;t offer you a cigar, Doctor, because you don&#8217;t
and I don&#8217;t smoke, but if I did I&#8217;d probably carry
them in this case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With that Bill drew forth the nickeled pistol
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
again, snapped it open and disclosed a rather
unique cigar case which he extended toward the
men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean that this thing was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that, Doctor. I hope we have respect for
the institution to which we have come for a much
needed and wanted education. But I saw no harm
in fooling those chaps who think they have the
right to compel us to lose a lot of time and money.
Am I right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>President Field was human; he tilted back his
head and laughed most heartily, nudging the professor
also, in quite a boyish way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are greatly relieved, and I wish you had
scared those young rascals more than you did.
Professor, we shall simply have to put a stop to
this hazing&mdash;stop it under pain of dismissal. And
this joke, now&mdash;it should be mentioned at chapel,
eh? I really want to thank you, young gentlemen,
for doing the school a distinct favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to add to the joke somewhat by to-morrow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
if you will kindly hold up that hazing
ban for one day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is that, may I ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind if we keep it a small secret
until then? We can promise to refrain from
anything dreadful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But then we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Doctor. This, if you will trust us, will
do more real good than anything the faculty can
do in the way of <i>verboten</i>. Just twenty-four
hours, Doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we shall see. From what Gray
wrote, I think we may trust you. Good evening,
boys.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HAZED?</h3>
</div>

<p>At the long supper table in the spacious basement
of the dormitory, many curious glances were
aimed at Bill and Gus, and many a terse remark
was shot at them respecting their departure from
the honorable ways and the rules of the school.
Most pronounced were the expressions of wonder
over the fact that the carrier of concealed weapons
had not been expelled, or suspended at once.
Finally a sophomore whose influence seemed to
count most gave voice to the prevailing sentiment:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must say if that gun had been pulled
on me, I&#8217;d have made the cad use it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you would, too, Siebold!&#8221; declared an
admirer.
</p>
<p>Bill got on his feet and there was an instant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
hush. There was something to expect from the
daring and apparently successful gunman. He
laughed, and that also charged the atmosphere.
When he spoke he had undivided attention:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have run like any other scared
puppy,&#8221; Bill said to Siebold. &#8220;We would have
listened to you ki-yi-ing for about a mile. Say,
look here, you hazers: You&#8217;re a bunch of muts!
Hear me? The whole lot of you couldn&#8217;t haze
anybody that puts up a fight, if you played anyway
fair and gave a little notice. We&#8217;ll give you
a dare, Siebold, you and all your deputies, though
I suppose you&#8217;ll send them and hang back yourself.
We&#8217;ll be ready to take all the hazing you
fellows can give to-morrow afternoon at about
three o&#8217;clock; only there isn&#8217;t one of you who will
have the nerve to show up. Oh, &#8216;no weapons?&#8217;
That was only a cigar case I pulled on you to-day.
It wouldn&#8217;t shoot, but, by cracky, it worked!&#8221;
And Bill laughed, with Gus and a few others who
admired the boy&#8217;s nerve.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>There was a sensation at once. Never before
in the history of the school had a freshman dared
the upper classmen to haze him, or had named
the time and place. Would such a plan hold out?
</p>
<p>It would, and it did. The very novelty of the
thing had assured it, as Bill expected. Some little
time before the hour given, a number of would-be
spectators began to gather in the hallway, as Bill
and Gus, studying in their room, could tell from the
tramping of feet outside their door. Then there
was the louder tramp of feet coming nearer and
without a preliminary call or knock the door flew
open. The chums looked up from their books with
well simulated surprise. In the doorway and
crowding behind stood several upper classmen and
easy confidence was written all over their eager
faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in, gentlemen; we are at your
service,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, men! What&#8217;s this? Wire entanglements?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>The question was opportune; flimsily stretched
across in front of the attacking party and about
shoulder high were some copper wires, and about
equally spaced below were others. It could be
seen that these offered no serious check, as anyone
could spread them apart and push through. It
was evidently with this intention that the hazers
fairly struggled through the door in the effort of
each to be first&mdash;at least half a dozen youths had
their hands on the wires. Then Bill leaned back
against the wall and his hand came in contact with
a button.
</p>
<p>Pandemonium! Cries of distress, yells of something
more than discomfort, howls of dismay, calls
for succor&mdash;the S O S in other than code signals.
This was a very pretty chorus increased by some
others who, hastily coming to the rescue, also
became entangled. The rest, chiefly onlookers,
refrained from too close acquaintance with the
very apparent cause of all the trouble. But the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
truly crucial part of the crisis was due to the fact
that those who suffered by contact with the wires
found it impossible to get away from the source
of distress.

<h3>GOOD WILL AND FIXTURES</h3>
</div>

<p>Bill made another motion touching the wall
button, and instantly, with a combined and very
audible gasp, the seven youths relaxed, got away
from the wires and stood up. There would probably
have been a general retreat mixed with a
volley of expletives hurled at Bill and Gus, had
not Gus taken a hand in the prevention of this, as
planned. A stream of water from a long syringe,
aimed over the heads of the sufferers, had cleared
the doorway of spectators. The jerk of a ceiling
cord slammed the door shut and it was deadlatched,
requiring a key to open it. The would-be
hazers, thus trapped and fearful of attempting a
further attack, turned, perforce, to face their
captors.
</p>
<p>But there was one fellow, Albert Shurtlief, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
so deeply resented the electric shocking that his
desire for instant retaliation robbed him of caution.
He was coming right over the wires again
and did get partly through before another touch
of the wall button gave him a second siege of
writhing. The others looked on in wonder, convinced
that the best thing they could do was to
remain quiescent. Gus said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let up on him, Bill, and if he wants to come
through&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the button. The still furious sophomore
did get past the wires and was going to make a
rush at Bill when Gus stood in his way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, please. You ought to go a little slow.&#8221;
That was a way Gus had in making a protest
against what might end in a scrap. But without
further ado, Shurtlief, who was commonly known
as &#8220;Scrapper Bert,&#8221; let fly an angry fist right at
Gus&#8217; exposed jaw.
</p>
<p>If the electrically charged wires had surprised
the mischief-making upper classmen, the sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
collapsing of their fistic champion shocked them
even more. Scrapper Bert was rather noted for
his prowess. No one cared to put on the gloves with
him, nor to gain his displeasure. To see the new
boy, a &#8220;measly freshman,&#8221; not as tall, as heavy
nor as old as Bert, catch the assailant&#8217;s hard-driven
fist in the palm of an instantly extended
hand and then let drive with his own right a neat,
short-arm uppercut that got Bert just where he
had meant to get Gus, was a needed lesson to the
smug conceit that too often goes with added school
years. Bert, from a seat on the floor, which he
had taken without choice of the spot, regarded his
opponent through half-closed eyes with a certain
nonchalance, his anger fled. He slowly got to his
feet, climbed back through the wires without
further thought as to their being charged, and
stood with his companions, quite submissive and
mute.
</p>
<p>As usual on all occasions demanding words,
Bill&#8217;s tongue was loosened:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, fellows, we want to give you the
right dope on this thing: You see we are here to
study&mdash;to try and go through if our money holds
out. Our people are not rich and, like Tom Edison
when he was a boy, we&#8217;ve got to hustle on short
allowance. And we really can&#8217;t afford to be
hazed, as you did that new chap yesterday. If we
had to buy new clothes and watches and caps, we&#8217;d
have to quit school&mdash;see? And we knew you never
missed anybody much, so we naturally, asking
your pardon, got up this nice little reception for
you. Now to get right down to brass tacks, you
see our position and respect it&mdash;everyone of you&mdash;and,
putting yourselves in our position, you
don&#8217;t blame us, nor hold any grudges; isn&#8217;t that
so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Siebold, spokesman, made reply, after thinking
a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I suppose all is fair in war. You&#8217;ve
had your innings now, of course, but we&#8217;ll have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
ours later.&#8221; And then he added: &#8220;We&#8217;ll get
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From what Doctor Field said, Bill and Gus
knew better. Hazing would be broken up on pain
of expulsion, as it should be in all schools where
the attendance is for business purposes, the getting
of a technical education as a means of livelihood.
The boys felt that perhaps in a college
art course, where education becomes much play
on the part of well-to-do lads, class fracases, bowl
fights, initiations and the like may not be amiss,
but they did not intend to let open brutality rob
them of their chance to study. And, however sure
they felt that Siebold&#8217;s threat was idle, there
would be a satisfaction in winning their own fight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s just what we want to talk to you
fellows about,&#8221; Bill declared. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want
to think about &#8216;getting&#8217; us. We want you to call
this all off and for good; we want you to give
your word on it; see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; began Siebold.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; Bill&#8217;s words came sharp and
clear. &#8220;Well, then, take a little more treatment
for your blamed foolishness.&#8221; And Bill touched
another button.
</p>
<p>The contortions, the writhings, the shrieks and
cries that followed quite surpassed the former
exhibitions. The well-worn woolen rug that fitted
from wall to wall across the end of the room where
stood the seven seemed to be charged with red
hot needles. Suddenly these ceased to leap and
jump and burn; the old rug and the hidden wires
under it were again quiescent. But the strident
voices of the afflicted prisoners were not silenced,
though the late lamentings were given over to a
medley of condemnations, appeals and pleadings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, go a little slow on this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it off, confound you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you trying to electrocute us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Brown, please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s call it quits, fellows!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll call it quits if you want. I suppose we&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
got to hand it to you two.&#8221; This last from Siebold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to call it all off, then? Give us your
word! We can&#8217;t believe that any fellows in Marshallton
Tech would go back on their word.&#8221; Bill
was smiling genially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be called in question. All off.
You&#8217;re exempt.&#8221; There was a general acquiescence
to this. The door slowly and to the seven
quite mysteriously swung open; the seven started
to file out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, fellows, and no hard feelings. We
were only having a little fun with you as you were
going to have with us. You can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but you two have still got to remember,&#8221;
said Siebold, shaking his finger at Bill and Gus,
&#8220;that you are freshies and must keep in your
places. You&#8217;ve got a little the better of us this
time, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly, Dan,&#8221; spoke up a fellow hazer, &#8220;a <i>little</i>
the better? Strikes me we&#8217;ve all been good and
licked and these chaps ought to get the credit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;  The voice died away along the hall
and Bill turned to his chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any credit, do we, Gus? But
we will get it just the same when this gets out. I
sort o&#8217; think our little stock has gone up about
one thousand percentum, even though we <i>are</i>
freshies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This proved quite correct. In a few minutes a
lot of freshmen had crowded into the room and
there was a sprinkling of sophs also. Questioned
eagerly, Bill explained quite freely the purpose of
the encounter and its result. Whereupon a big,
fat soph declared quite vehemently:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! They were easily licked. No pluck.
You&#8217;re lucky to have run into a bunch of quitters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have quit, eh, Jumbo?&#8221; ventured
another, grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Nothing like this contraption&mdash;&#8221; began
the husky fellow, advancing and laying his
hand on the top cross wire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not even for a little thing like this?&#8221; queried
Bill, reaching the wall button.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ow! Blazes! Quit! Don&#8217;t! Oh, darn! Stop!
Turn&mdash;it&mdash;off! E-e-e-e-e-! Help!&#8221; And the instant
the stabbing current ceased, Fatty fell back
from it and glared at Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You really can&#8217;t blame them for quitting, can
you?&#8221; asked Bill, and for answer the husky soph
turned and fled from the room, followed by the
jeering laughter of the crowd.
</p>
<p>And that ended it. After Bill had asked the
crowd if any or all of them wanted to test the
&#8220;convincer,&#8221; as he called the electrical rigging,
he bade the onlookers who filled the hallway a
pleasant <i>au revoir</i>, and Gus again pulled the
strings that closed the door.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>FAME AND FINANCES</h3>
</div>

<p>Nothing could have taken place to put the
lads from Freeport on the pedestal of fame more
noticeably than this experiment. They had easily
and modestly staged a complete breakdown of
the hazing habit at Marshallton Tech. Strangely
perhaps there was no blame nor suspicion put
upon Bill and Gus for the subsequent edict from
the faculty forbidding it. That seemed to be considered
a natural aftermath to the news of the
electrical reception of the hazers.
</p>
<p>The stunt did more than earn the boys a large
share of fame. It made them so deservedly
popular, even with most of the upper classmen,
that they soon counted a good many friends and a
considerable number of patrons for radio construction.
It is a rather odd fact that methods
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
already mastered by those of their own age appeal
to boys more than the teachings of their elders.
So, although the students were getting, or had got,
the theory of radio activity and the practice of
wireless fully stuffed into them, they turned often
to Bill and Gus for help. There were a number
of the well-to-do, even among the seniors, who
wanted radio receivers made, or coaching in making
their own, and to this Bill and Gus responded
out of school hours, with the consent of the president,
thus earning a good many dollars.
</p>
<p>So as not to interfere in any way with the
school-shop program, and not to crowd those lads
who were finding the room in the shop and the
tools to their advantage, Bill and Gus rented an
unused storeroom in the basement of the dormitory.
They cleared it out, sent for their own tools
at Freeport, purchased others&mdash;a foot-power lathe,
a jigsaw and a hand wall-drill&mdash;and put up some
benches. Besides working therein themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
they charged also the modest price of twenty-five
cents an hour to others mechanically inclined.
</p>
<p>The liberal-minded school faculty found no fault
with an arrangement which could only mean a
more thorough learning and a finer comradeship
among the students. The professors, who often
visited and even worked in the little shop&mdash;some
of them paying their quota also&mdash;came to refer
familiarly to the place as the &#8220;commercial and
sales department.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Professor Grant, the very able teacher of
physics, who possessed far more theoretical knowledge
than practice, gave the boys many valuable
ideas out of class, and got some himself, being also
a deadhead. And Search, the manual-training
teacher, who knew the use of tools as a bee knows
honey, got a few ideas while imparting many, as
he also was made welcome to tinker around the
boys&#8217; shop.
</p>
<p>These were truly strenuous days and weeks for
Bill and Gus. They had little studying to do, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Bill grasped problems as a trout takes in minnows,
and he needed but to coach Gus briefly. The latter
spent only a quarter-hour each day in the gym,
never indulging in contests, but content to work
hard at the things that best kept him fit. He had
elected not to put himself under the instructor,
grudging the time. But one day when he went
over and, with his bare, work-hardened fists,
punched a lively rubber bag for several minutes,
Professor LeRoy, who had been watching, came
to Gus with almost a demand that he join the
boxing class in view of the Marshallton Tech
entering contests with other schools during the
coming winter. But Gus declined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I haven&#8217;t the speed and I am weak with
my left, as you may have noticed. Hurt it once on
a lathe in my father&#8217;s shop; never will be any good
for quick work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will overcome that,&#8221; said the instructor,
&#8220;develop it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Also,&#8221; declared the boy, &#8220;I have neither the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
time nor the inclination. Must work and nothing
much else. But I thank you, Professor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, my boy; you&#8217;ve certainly got a wicked
right and you can use the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d want to use both,&#8221; asserted Gus, laughing.
</p>
<p>As for Bill, the hours each day and all of Saturday
spent in the shop sufficed for exercise; the
rest was spent in study, brief eating and no more
sleep than he needed. And nearly every moment
that could be spared found both boys in their shop.
</p>
<p>They had under way the construction of five
radio receivers of the finer type, for each of which
they would get sixty dollars, the materials costing
about fifteen dollars. These receivers were equal
to more than a thousand miles, with strong, durable
batteries and very wide amplification. As
with their first radio and the one for their good
old friend, Mr. Hooper, they made nearly all the
parts themselves, even to the switch arms, contacts,
buzzer and binding posts, cutting all threads
with a fine set of standard taps and dies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>They also had two crystal sets to make, for
which they charged twenty dollars each, and made
a profit of seventeen dollars over the cost of the
materials.
</p>
<p>The most interesting was the making of four
portable sets, with vacuum tube detectors and
loop aërials not over six inches in diameter, each
packed in small, neatly made wooden cases about
the size of an ordinary paper shoe box, the lids
when opened forming the upright panels and the
loop aërials hinged to open out and upright. Being
rather unique in design, and satisfying fads for
unusual construction, the boys felt they should get
at least fifty dollars for each of these sets, the
materials costing about twelve dollars.
</p>
<p>Earning enough in this way to help them along
very nicely with their schooling, and being more
deeply interested in their work than in anything
else, it was not surprising that Bill and Gus found
little time for play.
</p>
<p>When they had finished one of the larger and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
two cheaper sets, that upon installation at fraternity
and boarding houses were found to work most
satisfactorily, the cash was quickly paid over.
Bill divided it equally and handed half to Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t, old fellow!&#8221; Gus demurred.
&#8220;You get this and you can pay me a sort of wages
if you want to, or you needn&#8217;t. You did all of the
planning, the&mdash;&#8221; He got no further for Bill
started in with this indignant tirade:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fatheaded, heterogeneous, quadrangular
parallelepipedon! What are you trying to
get through your topknot, anyway? Don&#8217;t we
always work together? Isn&#8217;t it a partnership?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;er&mdash;Bill&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Butter bill&#8217;? Sure. This will pay our bread
bill, too, and our entire board bill for some time.
And what we&#8217;ll get out of these other sets will see
us through all of next year nicely, without worrying.
Then something will turn up for the third
year. Now, then, will you write to Cotton &amp;
Staples for that additional wire, or shall I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will, of course, but this money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up! If you say another word about
it, I&#8217;ll lam a battery coil at you&mdash;&#8216;b&#8217;gorry&#8217;&mdash;as
Mr. Hooper says. Well, now, reckon I&#8217;d better
turn up and thread some more binding posts.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER FELLOW</h3>
</div>

<p>It was in and over the work of the boys&#8217; shop
that Bill and Gus first met the Italian student.
Among the upper classmen they had noticed a
small, olive-skinned, black-eyed chap, with a rather
solemn face, who appeared to be very reticent. It
was said that he was a close and a bright student
who, though not lacking for money, took little interest
in sports, belonging only to the &#8220;bruisers,&#8221;
as the boxing class was called. One afternoon,
with Gandy, who was getting a radio set made, the
stranger appeared and stood in the doorway,
gazing at the busy workers. At first neither of
the radio experts saw him. Then he advanced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the desire very much to make for myself
complete a radio getter&mdash;ah&mdash;what you call? Yes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
a receiver.&#8221; He addressed Gus, who was laying
out the hook-up for a crystal set.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing very hard about it,&#8221; Gus
replied, looking up with his ready smile and
scrutinizing the Italian boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You pay the right here, the privilege; is that
not so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we rent the room,&#8221; said Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so; but I mean&mdash;&#8221; The newcomer turned
partly toward Bill who drew near at the moment
and had overheard the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean we charge those who work here?
Yes, for the use of our tools and machines, but
not for any hints and advice we can give. The
school shop is at your mercy, too, without charge,
as you know.&#8221;  Bill also sized up his questioner
with a certain curiosity and was pleasantly impressed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not like the school shop. There are so
very many con&mdash;con&mdash;what you call it? Yes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
conflicting. I should like&mdash;prefer&mdash;choose to come
here, if I may do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along. You keep account of your own
time here, and you can pay us when you like. You
can get your own materials, or we can get them for
you at the prices we pay. We bought up some old
pieces of furniture cheap to cut up for bases and
cabinets&mdash;enough walnut to make a hundred. No
charge for it. Help yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are, I wish to say it, veree liber&mdash;kind&mdash;generous.
It is too little that you pay&mdash;charge, I
mean it. I will ask for your materials and I will
commence&mdash;begin&mdash;start, eh? on to-morrow. Will
that be satisfy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any old time. If we are not here, walk in and
go to it. Check your hours up on this pad, see?
What is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Sabaste it is. I am called Tony by
most. My country it is Italy, but American I now
am. My father is of the city&mdash;living there. Here,
now, I will pay you five dollars on acc&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather have
you pay after a while and you can see that the
work goes all right. Here, I&#8217;ll show you the
ropes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ropes? But I care not to make&mdash;build a ship.
It is a radio&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure, I get you; but that&#8217;s only slang.
You have been here long enough, I should guess
from your talk, to get on to our American guff.
Well, we&#8217;re glad to know you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sabaste, but I best like&mdash;I prefer calling me
Tony. It means in your language, I get on to it,
as fine, grand, fat&mdash;no&mdash;but swell out&mdash;somebody
much, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does, sure! I&#8217;ll introduce my partner,
Augustus Grier; Gus for short, or he&#8217;ll get mad.
They call me Bill Brown, generally forgetting the
Brown, even here at school, where &#8217;most everyone
gets his last name. First names are more
friendly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it, too. In my native it is more mostly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Signor, even to young&mdash;what you call it? Kids, as
us, eh?&#8221; Tony smiled genially, his face lighting
up most agreeably. &#8220;Some they call me &#8216;Wop,&#8217;
or &#8216;Sphagetti&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys learned that the intelligent young
foreigner was in the graduating class which had
escaped a lot of practical radio work; that he kept
much to himself, either because of a real or fancied
notion that social lines might be drawn against
him, or because he was naturally unsocial. But
after he began the making of a radio set and came
in daily contact with Bill and Gus, the young
Italian seemed to grow a little out of himself,
becoming less reticent and secluded. The good
fellowship of two lads a little younger than he,
both giving him friendship and confidence, laughing
at his errors of speech in perfect good nature
and without ridicule, and at their own foibles as
well, compelled the Italian boy to like the country
of his adoption much better than he had before.
This he expressed to Gus:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You like me&mdash;no, I mean I you like. Yes, that
is making to laugh, eh? Funny, very. Well, I
mean to say it, you and Bill very much also. Why
not? You love the live. You love the study. You
make the happiness. You have the great&mdash;the
large, eh? the big heart. All to you is nice and
fine and it is equal to the doing, but you say it, it
is worth the while. This makes good-will and
kind thoughts to others, also by others&mdash;no; from
others. You are like one <i>dolce</i> picture in my home.
It is by two little birds fabricating their nest and
all the time thus they are of song, singing, gay
with living and working, helping so much always
also to make all the country, this old world happy
and satisfy&mdash;content. So, to my&mdash;to me, you are
really it, eh? You are the real thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Bill had heard you say all this, Tony, he&#8217;d
declare you&#8217;re both an orator and a poet,&#8221; said
Gus, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And neither am I. But of my country there
are many of such, and of learning also, science,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
the great learning. Many large men of the yesterday
and many of the to-day also. In this work,
too, the first, for is not Marconi&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say that name to Bill and hear him shout some
praises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So? And will Bill speak good&mdash;noble&mdash;high of
Signor Marconi? Then I, too, can speak noble of
Signor Edison, the American. But what say now
if I can tell it to you that my father, he is one
sure and big friend of Signor Marconi. Our home,
in Italia, what you call&mdash;the estate of us, it is not
much a great distance from Signor Marconi of
his estate. Often I have seen him. And so you
understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By cracky! Radio must have been in the air
over there and you caught it!&#8221; declared Gus.
&#8220;Nobody could have it down any more pat than
you have. Bill and I have got some dandy ideas
from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That we have,&#8221; agreed Bill, thumping in.
&#8220;What is it now, Gus, that our friend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bill, Tony knows Marconi! Just telling
me about it.&#8221; And Gus went on briefly to repeat
that which the Italian had related. Bill, to use a
terse but slangy term, proceeded to go up in the
air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, holy cats, Tony, you are from henceforth
the cheese! This school has gone wireless
mad,&mdash;you know that,&mdash;and the country is pretty
much in the same fix, and for the reason that radio
is about the biggest thing in the world. And, fellows,
this just fits. We are doing things&mdash;everybody
is&mdash;in radio and now we are going&mdash;this
school is going&mdash;to honor the situation if we can
start it that way. For, fellows, Marconi&#8217;s yacht,
the <i>Elettra</i>, is in New York Harbor, with Marconi
on board most of the time. And Tony, we&#8217;ll
get Doctor Field to let us have a whack at the
transmitter and you can talk to your friend, or
telegraph your dad and have him come up and
radiophone Marconi. And then we&#8217;ll listen in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
for his reply, for I&#8217;ve read he&#8217;s awfully fine and
good-natured. Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so, sure and indeed!&#8221; declared the Italian
youth. &#8220;I am overenjoyed; you say so, eh? that
we shall do this. Let us now go, upon this moment,
and talk to the good doctor. There will be no
lecturing at this time over the casting abroad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The broadcasting transmitter? No, we can
surely get a whack at it.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MESSAGES</h3>
</div>

<p>Doctor Field, much interested, accompanied the
boys to the school broadcasting room, and after
determining from some data at hand the wave
lengths that would be receivable on the Marconi
yacht, Tony began talking earnestly, almost too
rapidly, into the horn, the crack and buzzing of
the battery charges making a sound like that of a
rifle gallery. The president, Bill and Gus also had
receiving &#8217;phones clamped to their ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t mind, you might ask him to reply
in English, please,&#8221; requested the Doctor, and
Tony nodded.
</p>
<p>And presently a reply did come, though in
Italian. Tony got it, at some little length; then
with a gesture of disappointment he turned to the
others:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is an attend&mdash;an assister. He informs me
that the wireless wizard, Signor Marconi, whom I
explain is a friend to me and my family and he
know our name, that the signor is away on the
earth&mdash;no, on land, you say it,&mdash;attends some
occasion, or is entertain of American friends and
he will not return this many hour. So that it is
no value, or you say useless, to cast wide to him
again now at this moment and I am, as you say,
deject?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all laughed and cheered Tony with the
assurance that there would be another occasion.
Then Bill offered his idea to the president:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor, we have a notion that this radio business
right now ought to have a sort of celebration
&#8217;most everywhere; and our school might set the
example. Radio is getting to be an awfully big
thing, nearly as big as the movies. And now
here&#8217;s Marconi. Couldn&#8217;t we start a general
hurrah for radio, bring the apparatus down to the
assembly room, have a big concert, send out some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
messages and get Tony here, who knows Marconi,
to give us a talk on the inventor of the wireless
when he was a boy, and that sort of thing? Of
course, if this would interfere with studies,
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It need not, Brown, it need not in the least,&#8221;
agreed the president. &#8220;I like your idea immensely
and I foresee some features that we can
add. Suppose we fix it for the latter part of this
week, handbill it in the town also and make it a
gala occasion. It is another way of calling attention
to the school and the kind of work we do here.
You will all help Professor Grant and the janitor
with the mechanical details, which should not take
long. And if Sabaste will communicate with
Marconi so as to make sure we can get a message
from him, that will be the climax.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The idea proved immensely popular. There are
many such plans for calling students together to
instil interest in various things that prove &#8220;wet
blankets&#8221; when put into operation, but radio, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
elsewhere, had taken the school by storm. Separate
departments had been organized this year for
it. It was equally an interesting plaything and a
source of mental gymnastics. It was a matter of
curiosity, and not to be interested, was to be out
of the swim.
</p>
<p>Bill got busy, as hardly ever before in his strenuous
career. Because of his uncertain English,
Tony balked at giving an address on Marconi, so
Bill copied facts and wrote the whole thing out
for Tony to memorize, putting in many of the
Italian&#8217;s phrases, corrected. And getting the
<i>Elettra</i> again, Marconi&#8217;s former and youthful
neighbor was able to make a date for a message
from the wireless wizard on the evening of the
radio celebration.
</p>
<p>That night there was a crowd in the assembly
room. Every student was there, half the town,
many people from the country around and a few
friends of the school from various distances.
Doctor Field introduced the occasion briefly. Professor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Grant gave a talk on the history and rapid
growth of radio communication. Professor Judson,
assistant in physics, talked on the &#8220;little
bottles,&#8221; as the vacuum tubes are often called.
Professor Search talked on the possible future of
radio. Then the Doctor arose again and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to have members of our student body,
also, express to you our interest in this great
subject. We are fortunate to have this year a
pupil who, though yet a freshman, has shown an
unusual grasp of the technicalities of radio. I am
going to ask Mr. William Brown to explain briefly
some of the methods employed in building, or
selecting, a radio receiving set, such as those he
has been engaged in making here at the school.
His associate, Mr. Augustus Grier, who is an
artist, in mechanical matters at least, will aid
Mr. Brown at the blackboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill laid aside his crutch and hobbled forward
to the platform, followed by Gus, whose easy motions
were in direct contrast. A round of applause
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
greeted the boys. This was increased and a burst
of laughter added when Gus took a piece of chalk
and with a few quick strokes made what suggested
a broadcasting station, with a rooster shouting
&#8220;cock-a-doodle-doo&#8221; into the transmitter. Then
he drew a lot of zigzag lines to indicate the Hertzian
waves, and at the other end of the board, a
hen listening in and registering horror when she
hears the sounds translated into &#8220;quack, quack.&#8221;
Meanwhile, Bill had plunged headlong into his
subject.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>RADIO GALORE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A good many folks,&#8221; said Bill, &#8220;get scared
when they think about radio construction. The big
words come at them all in a bunch like a lot of
bees, and it is to dodge. And when they go to the
dictionary they are lost for sure. Potentiometer,
variometer, variocoupler, radio frequency, amplification,
loop aërials, audion and grids&mdash;no, I am
not saying these words to show off. They are only
a part of radio terminology. And you&#8217;ve got to
get &#8217;em, or you might as well take radio theory
and construction on faith and be satisfied simply
to listen in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody can commit these words to memory
without a dictionary, and that&#8217;s where my partner
shines. He has heard the big words so much that
he talks them in his sleep, and he ought to know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
all their meanings, but the one most his size is
&#8216;grid.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here Gus drew a much scared boy, with hair on
end and knees knocking together, surrounded by a
lot of the words that Bill had pronounced. Then
Bill, putting his hand to the side of his mouth and
leaning toward his audience as though in confidence,
said in a stage whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s doing that to show that he knows how to
spell these words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To be serious about it, if I&#8217;m allowed,&#8221; continued
Bill, &#8220;this subject of radio is a coiner in
every way. Just think of someone saying something
in San Francisco and someone else in Maine
listening to it, and without any speaking tubes, nor
wires to carry the sound along! A good many
folks are wondering how it happens&mdash;how speech
can be turned into electricity that goes shooting in
all directions and how this is turned back into
speech again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s done on the telephone, over wires.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
The voice in the receiver is turned into electric
energy that passes over the wires and at the other
end turns again into sounds exactly like the voice
that started it. But somebody found out that this
same energy could be shot into the air in all directions
and carried any distance, maybe as far as the
stars, and then when pretty much the same principles
were applied to this as to the telephone, with
some more apparatus to send and catch the energy,
why, then, that was wireless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really too bad, with all the useless short
syllables in our language going to waste, that the
fellows who got up the terms for radio work
couldn&#8217;t have used words like &#8216;grid,&#8217; for instance.
They could have called a variocoupler a &#8216;gol,&#8217; a
potentiometer a &#8216;dit,&#8217; an induction coil a &#8216;lim,&#8217;
(l-i-m) and a variable condenser would look just
as pretty if it were written out as a &#8216;sos&#8217;&mdash;but no!
They forgot the good example set by the grid, the
volt and the ohm and they went and used jawbreakers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you another thing that makes this
electro-motive force as used in wireless easier to
understand. It is the sun and its light. A great
scientist, Doctor Steinmetz, says that light and
electric waves are the same thing. Perhaps they
are, though they surely work differently under
different conditions. But if the sun has an awful
lot of heat it can&#8217;t send it ninety-five million miles&mdash;not
in reason! The heat only makes light and
that light travels through space. It reaches the
atmosphere of our earth and is converted into heat
again. Perhaps light of the sun and stars and the
reflected light of the planets do not shine through
space as light, but as radio waves that either by
our atmosphere, or by our electrical conditions
here are converted into light again,&mdash;but this is
hardly open to proof even.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill glanced at the blackboard; Gus had drawn
a big sun, with radiating rays, a grinning face, a
small body with one short leg and two gesturing
hands and had labeled it &#8220;Bill Brown, radio radiator.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Bill made a motion of his thumb toward the
caricature, then spread his hands in mock despair,
but not without a side glance expressing pride in
his lieutenant&#8217;s performance, all of which pleased
the audience immensely.
</p>
<p>Then Bill proceeded: &#8220;This electro-motive force
which travels around and through our little earth
is what we can actually experiment with. We do
not know just what it is, but we are finding out
pretty fast what it will do. Perhaps there is
hardly any limit to what it will do. It is generated
for power and light and heat, for carrying signals
and sounds over wires and through the air. What
next? Just now we have got all the thinking we
can do about radio. It is the sixth wonder that
electricity has sprung upon us. I guess we won&#8217;t
include electrocution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s no use going into technicalities
about construction, that&#8217;s a thing that must be
studied out and thought over, not mussed up in a
talk like this. I&#8217;ll say this much, however, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
the vacuum or audion tube detector that gives
results, and the application of a loud speaker is
only possible with a vacuum or audion tube. It
is as easy to build a vacuum tube set as a crystal
set and only a very little more expensive. So,
whether you are building or buying a set, make it
a good set, something that you can hear with a
good many hundred miles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you can buy the parts and build a receiving
set that will generally give more satisfaction
than a bought set.&#8221; (Bill stepped over to the
blackboard and took up a pointer.) &#8220;I may need
this for this partner of mine if he persists in
caricaturing me instead of drawing what we want.
We&#8217;ll make things about four times as big as they
ought to be. You can use an aërial outdoors,
which everybody now understands, or, just as well
and a lot handier, a loop aërial indoors, the bigger
the better, but two feet in diameter is big enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is your base and upright panel and this
is the way to hook up or wire the parts. Here&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
your aërial and its ground, between which is
placed your variable condenser and tuning coil,
thus, off here between condenser and coil comes
the wire to your vacuum tube, with its fixed condenser
and grid leads, the wire being connected
directly to the grid, while here the wire from the
tube plate is connected with the six-volt storage
battery and in turn with the phones, like this.
Then, from the phones to the ground wire, the
wire is carried thus through a secondary dry cell
battery, on each side of which the wires are taken
off to a rheostat, though my partner has sketched
this to look more like a bird after a caterpillar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to tell you how to make all
these parts&mdash;if I did you&#8217;d probably go to sleep,
if you are not half way there already. So, if
you can&#8217;t find out how to make the parts, or contrive
them in some way yourself, why, then, you&#8217;d
better buy them. Only you can make the base and
do the wiring, attaching and so forth. Even my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
partner can do that if he is watched pretty closely;
it is almost as easy as making a sketch of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If any of you really want to know how to build
a radio set in a practical, get-there way, all you&#8217;ll
have to do is to get Doctor Field&#8217;s consent and
come round to our shop in the basement of the
school dormitory and we won&#8217;t soak you much.
I thank you all for your attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very warm applause indicated the approval of
the audience, as Bill and Gus left the platform.
Again the president arose to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another of our students has a message for us
in regard to radio. Among the notable pioneers
and probably one to give the subject its greatest
practical impetus is William Marconi, whose name
is familiar to you all. The great inventor is now
an honored guest of this country, his yacht
<i>Elettra</i> lying off our shores. It seems doubly fitting
that more than special mention should be
made of him, and as Mr. Antonio Sabaste was, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
his native land, a neighbor of Marconi, his father
being really a friend of the wizard, I think we shall
listen with pleasure to what this student of the
school has to say.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MARCONI</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My native country,&#8221; said Tony, speaking very
slowly in an effort to get the construction of his
sentences in accordance with Bill&#8217;s coaching and
as per his written arrangement, &#8220;is Italy; my
adopted country is America. I say both with
pride, and therefore you can imagine with what
delight I speak about one of the greatest of Italians
and one of the greatest among the scientists
of the world, to Americans who perhaps most appreciate
and make use of his discoveries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guglielmo Marconi lived not far from Bologna.
His father&#8217;s estate is called &#8216;Villa Griffone.&#8217;
Not far from these many acres was my
former home, and my father, who is a little older
than Signor Marconi, knew him well, as well indeed
as anyone might know one who was from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
boyhood a rather shy, retiring fellow, with a mind
given over largely to mechanical experiments and
caring very little for playfellows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Signor Marconi, the elder, was proud of his
son&#8217;s tendencies and gave him mechanical toys
when Guglielmo was only a little fellow. His
mother was a beautiful English or Irish lady and
she also encouraged her son in his tastes. Electricity
had a strange fascination for the boy and
as he grew older and began to grasp the theories
and methods employed in its use he addressed
himself more and more to electrical phenomena,
never being content with mere performances, but
being eager to know the precise methods of application
and effect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At first Guglielmo had tutors and he led them
a merry chase to keep up with his questions.
Then, when still young, he was sent to an advanced
school in Leghorn, later entering the University
at Bologna. But with all that he learned
of theory and practice concerning what had become
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
his hobby, he obtained more knowledge at
home, for his investigations were not along discovered
routes, but in new fields.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Guglielmo was only sixteen his father
had provided him with all the instruments and
apparatus he could wish for and he knew no
handicaps of this kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this country a poor boy, without social
hindrances, has an equal chance with a rich lad.
In my native land, in Europe I think, the lad with
means has a better opportunity. Here you have
many great men in every walk of life who have
been poor, but over there that is a rare thing.
Wealth brings opportunity and quick recognition.
Guglielmo had this advantage, but if he had not
also possessed an earnest, painstaking and brilliant
mind he could have gained no distinction.
Most of his acquaintances led pleasure-loving,
easy, indolent lives and he could have done the
same thing. Therefore, what credit is due Guglielmo
for the great success he has achieved!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While Guglielmo was still in his teens he
turned his father&#8217;s estate into a vast laboratory
and experimenting station. His great success
seemed to come from using all outdoors as his
workshop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way he learned the magic of sound
waves and vibrations, so that he could send his
&#8216;telegrams&#8217; without a wire. His first experiments
were for only a few yards. Then he made the
distance longer and longer, little by little, till at
the end of five years of constant, persevering
trial, with thousands of failures to be sure, he sent
an air message two miles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, people made fun of him. They
thought he was a crank, if not downright crazy
and said that his father was very foolish indeed
to encourage him in wasting so much time and
money in a way that every person with common
sense could see was worse than merely simple.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guglielmo set his rude transmitting apparatus
on a pole on one side of a field and on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the other side a corresponding pole was set up and
connected with a receiving apparatus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The young inventor&#8217;s interest must have been
keen and his hopes high as he sat and watched
for the tick of his recording instrument, that he
knew should come from the spark sent across the
field. Weeks had been spent in the building of
these instruments, now to be tested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly the Morse sounder began to record
the distant transmission and the boy&#8217;s heart gave
an exultant bound&mdash;the first wireless message had
been sent and received.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Many experiments followed. Varying heights
of poles were used and it was found that the distance
could be increased in proportion to the altitude
of the poles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In these first experiments of the young inventor
he used practically the same methods that
he employs to-day. The transmitting apparatus
consisted of electric batteries, an induction coil by
which the force of the current is increased, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
telegrapher&#8217;s key to make and break the circuit.
Batteries were connected with the induction coil
and the telegrapher&#8217;s key was placed between the
battery and the coil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One spark made a single dot, a stream of
sparks the dash of the Morse telegraphic code,
and with this crude apparatus, sometimes failing
to record the signals, Marconi labored with growing
faith. He knew he was on the right track and
persevered. When he had succeeded in sending
a message two miles through the air, Guglielmo
determined that it could be two hundred, or two
thousand miles, but he chose a shorter distance to
prove his theory. He went to the English Channel
and before long the world was astounded to
learn that this young stranger and experimenter
had sent a wireless message over thirty miles. A
little later dispatches were sent through the air
across the English Channel and received from the
Isle of Wight to Land&#8217;s End, more than one hundred
and eighty miles distant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This youth, twenty-one years old, had succeeded
in accomplishing a feat the possibilities
of which can hardly yet be conceived. Then Marconi
came to London to upbuild and link nation
to nation more closely. He was well received in
England and began his further work with all the
encouragement possible. A series of tests followed
that were astounding. Messages were sent
through walls, houses, through hill and dale, proving
beyond a doubt that the electric waves penetrate
everything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years later, when Marconi was twenty-four,
he made wireless reports of the Kingston
regatta for evening papers in Dublin, Ireland.
This attracted Queen Victoria&#8217;s attention at her
summer residence at Osborne House, also on the
Isle of Wight. At this time the Prince of Wales,
who afterward became King Edward the Seventh,
was ill on his yacht. This was soon connected
with the Queen&#8217;s summer castle and one hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
and fifty messages passed between the suffering
prince and his royal mother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All these wireless marvels&mdash;they seemed miracles
then&mdash;made William Marconi world-famous
before he finished his twenty-fifth year.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Guglielmo&mdash;I like the Italian pronunciation
of his name better,&#8221; continued Tony, &#8220;for
I am afraid, if I did geeve the English form, I
should turn it into Beel.&#8221; He smiled at our hero
who had come down from the platform to a front
seat and sat listening intently, and Bill Brown
shook his head deprecatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guglielmo did not cease with these triumphs.
No, not he. He saw success only in greater distances
and he went at this problem with his usual
quiet determination. He made no announcements,
but sailed for the Island of Newfoundland
and there he set up his instruments in an old barracks
at the mouth of the harbor near St. Johns.
In a few days his preparations were made, quite
secretly. His plans were communicated to no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
one, except his assistants, for he knew there would
be the general skepticism concerning his effort
to send wireless messages across the Atlantic
Ocean, but he felt assured of success. A transmitting
station had been established near Poldhu,
Cornwall, the southwestern point of England.
The aërial wires were on masts two hundred and
ten feet high.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As an aërial Guglielmo sent up a large kite
made of bamboo and silk, flown on a wire, of
course; the wind increased, snapping the wire and
blowing the kite into the ocean. Thereupon
Guglielmo used a balloon filled with hydrogen gas
and sent it up when the weather was clear, but
the balloon broke away and disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on December 12, 1901 that he sent up
another kite. This held at an elevation of nearly
four hundred feet, and then, after having cabled
his assistants to begin sending certain signals
previously agreed upon, at a certain hour in the
afternoon and continuing until night, Guglielmo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
made allowance for the difference in time and sat
with the telephone receiver at his ear, listening,
wondering, hopeful. It must have been a moment
of almost painful expectation. He looked out
from his position high on the cliff and could see
the dim, rocky outlines of Cape Spear, the most
eastern point of the North American continent.
Beyond this rolled the blue Atlantic, two thousand
miles across which was the coast of the British
Isles. Only two persons were present in the old
barrack-room besides the inventor. There were
no reporters&mdash;no one had been apprised of the
attempt. Marconi&#8217;s faith in the success of his
experiment was unshaken. He believed from the
first that he would get signals across the great
stretch of ocean.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly there was the sharp click of the
instrument that could only come from some electric
disturbance; but it was not the signal. Marconi,
without excitement, asked Mr. Kemp, the
assistant, to take the telephone receiver connected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
with the instrument and listen for a time. A moment
later, faintly, yet distinctly and unmistakably,
came the three clicks indicating the dots of
the letter S, according to the Morse code, the signal
that had been agreed upon with the assistants
on the English coast. A few minutes later more
signals came and the inventor and his assistant
assured themselves again and again that there
could be no mistake. Thus was tested successfully
one of the great scientific discoveries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the achievement was given to the public,
after two days of repeated signaling. The honors
that were at once heaped upon Marconi would
have turned the head of anyone less modest and
sane. From every quarter of the world came
plaudits. The cable company, fearing injury to
its business, demanded that he cease operations
in its territory, which was a high compliment,
indeed. The people of the Colony of Newfoundland
honored him, wondering at his youth; he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
then only twenty-seven, but an experimenter of
wide knowledge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such was the practical achievement upon a
great discovery reached by Marconi the Italian
and now, more correctly, the cosmopolitan.
Though he still makes his home in his native land,
he belongs to all countries, to all oceans, for it
is everywhere now that his great discovery is
made use of. No need for me to mention the
present day uses of wireless telegraphy and radio
communication aided greatly by the inventions
of others. But it is to Marconi these owe their
initial adoption.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A MESSAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>A round of applause was given the Italian lad
as he was about to leave the platform. Suddenly
Tony stopped and held up his hand for silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not&mdash;ah, applaud to me for this
speaking. I have the inspire to do it, yes, but
not the words entire. So it is my friend Brown
who set me correct on the words and the speeching.
We are then both equally the speechers, my
friend Bill Brown and I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The applause was continued now,&mdash;a goodly
number appreciated the honesty of this declaration.
Tony had taken his seat. The president
arose and began to talk again, but could not be
heard for some mischief-making students who
kept up the racket.
</p>
<p>Gus leaned over and spoke to Tony and then to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
Bill. Without more ado Bill got up, grabbed
Tony&#8217;s hand and the two got out on the floor,
faced about and bowed. The clapping took a spasmodic
leap and ceased.
</p>
<p>Bill pushed Tony away from him and limped
back several feet. Then he put his hollowed fist
to his mouth and shouted into it:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is broadcasting station P D Q! I hope
you are listening in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tony caught the idea at once and put his hand
to his ear. Bill continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strikes me this crowd here is crazy! A noisy
bunch! Maybe they think we&#8217;re candidates for
mayor, or something! This radio business is some
pumpkins; eh, boy? I&#8217;d radiophone you a message
in Italian, only I&#8217;ve left my dictionary at
home! Well, I guess they&#8217;ve looked at us long
enough now, so let&#8217;s switch off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Amid laughter, the boys returned to their
seats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a gala occasion,&#8221; said Doctor Field,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
&#8220;and you must bear with the exuberance of our
youthful enthusiasts. We have one other interesting
experience for you, demonstrating the wonders
of radio. Now, then, Mr. Sabaste, if you
will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tony and Gus quickly left the room. Presently,
through the open door and from above, sharp,
cracking sounds something like miniature pistol
shots were heard. There was also a droning buzz
and the sound of a loud speaking voice, the words
unrecognized. The president added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sabaste is now broadcasting a message,
in Italian, to the yacht <i>Elettra</i>, outside New York
harbor. He previously appointed this hour to
send such a communication to none other than
<i>Signor</i> William Marconi, asking him for a message
to our school. We hope Sabaste may be successful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few moments the sounds from the transmitter
in the broadcasting room ceased. There
came a brief period of expectant silence, some of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the audience staring about uncertainly, others
more intelligently looking at the big horn of the
receiver on the platform table. The time lengthened.
It threatened to grow a little tedious.
Then as Tony and Gus hastily appeared in the
doorway, the sound of a human voice and good,
clear English words emanated from the horn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The yacht <i>Elettra</i>, Marconi speaking. My
young friend, the son of my friend Sabaste, now
a citizen of America, has asked me to send a word
of greeting to the Marshallton Technical College,&mdash;I
hope I have the name correctly. I confess my
being called on seems rather unusual, but yet I am
glad to be able to communicate with an American
educational institution, especially one devoted to
physical knowledge, mechanics and electricity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not unlikely you have among your students
some future great inventors&mdash;perhaps some
Edison, Bell or Morse&mdash;time will only determine
this. America is a nation of inventors&mdash;the leaders
in this mechanical age. Study, close application,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the not too stringent adherence to formulæ
and old methods are bound to win. Inspiration,
vision, the seizing of opportunities to improve,
the wish to gain something desired&mdash;these are the
keynotes to success in the field of mechanical endeavor
and scientific discovery. In the words of
one of the greatest Americans who had visions
and did things: &#8216;It is up to you.&#8217; I wish your
school and its students every success.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice in the horn ceased to be heard. There
was a moment of breathless silence, as everyone
in the audience, with attention riveted on the
radio receiver, listened for other words to follow.
Then once again the Doctor was on his
feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall later radio our gratitude to Mr.
Marconi for this kind and helpful message which
is a fitting climax to our wireless celebration.
We feel that our students have been benefited and
inspired and we hope you have all been entertained.
Good night.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FEUDAL FOOLERY</h3>
</div>

<p>There seemed to be a dissatisfying influence, a
feeling perhaps akin to envy, or at least as offending
class pride in the sentiment that arose among
a certain clique concerning Bill Brown. The boy
had become popular and it was thought by some
unduly, or somewhat undeservedly so. Bill&#8217;s
classmates had not shown this tendency, or if so
individually it was not made evident. But to certain
older fellows, that a mere freshman should
so shine both in the opinion of teachers and the
student body generally, seemed most inconsistent.
</p>
<p>Siebold, the moving spirit of wholesome mischief
among the upper classmen, seemed to be the
chief instigator of the tendency to belittle Bill,
aided by one Luigi Malatesta, a Sicilian. Siebold
never had forgiven Bill and Gus for the electrical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
trap sprung on his hazing party. He had a certain
following that shared most of his opinions
and plans.
</p>
<p>Malatesta was also a soph, with a very decided
penchant for getting into trouble and showing
temper. It might have been expected that between
the only two natives of Italy in the school
there would be at least some fraternal feeling,
but these lads appeared instinctively to avoid each
other, and Tony&#8217;s being a senior, made this easily
possible on his part. Malatesta, seeing that Bill
and Gus were both exceedingly friendly with
Tony, seemed to take especial pleasure in making
contemptuous remarks concerning all three, or
in making offensive, insulting gestures that they
could not help seeing. At first this was altogether
puzzling because the motive was not apparent.
It became more evident, however, following
an incident.
</p>
<p>Bill and Tony were coming from the school
library, to be followed later by Gus, who remained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
to add some notes. The subject with which they
were all wrestling covered voltmeter tests and
relative amperage, principally with regard to battery
construction. The boys were building their
own batteries and must make no mistakes.
</p>
<p>Bill was thumping along, talking, and Tony
listening, as usual. They came through the double
swinging doors of the dormitory on the way to
the shop and passed a small group of upper classmen
in the hallway, Malatesta among them, holding
forth. The two went down the basement
stairway, a door closed behind them and they were
alone. Tony stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may ask you, <i>mio amico</i>, you did see that
fellow, my countryman, up there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill nodded, wondering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is so,&#8221; continued Tony, &#8220;that he
watches us&mdash;you because of me, and me because
of&mdash;to tell you it is something, shall I? Yes, it
will give me satisfy. That Malatesta&mdash;Luigi his
name it is&mdash;why you think he comes on this school?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
I will say he comes to spy to me. Perhaps you
think this is absurd quite, but not so. In Italy
his people and my people are at fighting&mdash;no, you
call it &#8216;scrap,&#8217; eh? We make war, by family. My
mother&#8217;s people, one of the years long ago, kill
one of this fellow&#8217;s people at the town <i>festa</i> and
they seek to kill all her people and my father&#8217;s
people take no part&mdash;know nothing. But when
my father meet my mother and they are declared
to marry, then the Malatesta fight with him and
his people. Is it not strange and very ridiculo?
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I am come to the family war because
no more longer a little child and this Luigi he
swear he look after me here in America, and
already I see the poniard lifted to strike at my
breast, but I shall dodge and then maybe use my
own, though hating the vendetta&mdash;feuds. Why
shall all this be? How have I made anger and
strife with these assassins? But to reason with
them is to invite a more insult than death. You
understand my telling?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I do,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;It is what we call in
this country a feud, but it is rotten. Why don&#8217;t
you go to the Doctor and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! My friend Bill, you cannot intend
so. That would be poltrone&mdash;coward! We fight
without people stopping&mdash;to end, if must be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a fellow like that&mdash;to come to school here
just&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but he is smart, Luigi Malatesta, and to
him learning is also good, though some of his
people are low and many years ago they were of
the banditti. And some were of the boat builders
and some were rich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys had reached the shop and were still
alone. Bill forgot his loved problems in trying
to comprehend this state of affairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t understand how such a thing could
really be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the black hand, it
is true, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, this the black hand is never!&#8221; declared
Tony. &#8220;This is of families&mdash;not to rob, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
maybe they do rob in time and ask of ransoms.
Such was done by some Malatesta of my mother&#8217;s
cousin and he was lost to us, never returning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, confound it, Tony, here he wouldn&#8217;t
dare&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he will dare more than in Italy, because
there all who make family wars are suspect and
many such quit and have become friends when
time goes, but other forgetta never. This Luigi
he forgetta never, and maybe you will see. We&mdash;my
father thought we had left behind this fighting,
but to this country also come Malatesta, for small
is the world and large is hate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill pondered this and turned to his work, but
dropped his tools in a moment, explaining to Tony
that there were other figures they must have for
calculating the strength of the battery and he
would go back and tell Gus.
</p>
<p>Bill reached the basement stairs, and in an
alcove, alone, as though seeking to hide, was the
fellow Luigi. He turned sharply, facing Bill and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
glaring in evident resentment at the latter&#8217;s broad,
curious stare. Then the Sicilian spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see me. I it is, freshman. Stare at
me some more as if I were something to step on
and I will give you more reason to stare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, you, you&mdash;&#8221; demanded
Bill, stopping short and much incensed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Wop? Guinea? Dago? Sphagett&mdash;so I
am insulta&mdash;is it? And by a short-leg!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have short legs than short brain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you so well I smash you in the face!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word Luigi advanced
upon Bill, who turned and swung his crutch menacingly.
</p>
<p>What then would have occurred it is impossible
to surmise, for the crippled boy was handy with
the familiar implement that so readily could be
used as a weapon, though the Italian was sturdier,
heavier and much older&mdash;in fact, although small,
he was almost a man.
</p>
<p>But just at the moment there was a quick, descending
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
footfall on the stair and the door opened.
Gus, with wide eyes, stared at the near and unequal
combatants.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said the big fellow, glaring. The
Italian hesitated, though but for a moment. &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t really hit a fellow who is lame, would
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, get away! Go off!&#8221; snarled Malatesta,
attempting to thrust Gus aside as the strapping
youth stepped in front of him. But the thrust was
futile and then Luigi, growing furious, struck at
Gus a powerful blow. The fellow was muscular
and quick, but there was no thought behind
the blow. And there was in contrast a smile on
the face of the easy, athletic American.
</p>
<p>The Italian&#8217;s fist was clutched by a ready hand,
much as a baseball would have been caught, and
then a very differently directed fist shot out and
came in contact with Luigi&#8217;s upper stomach&mdash;he
got that generally final solar plexus blow. Luigi
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
gave a soft, aching grunt and sank to his knees,
then to his elbows and rolled over on his side, in a
half-minute more sitting up and gazing around,
but still in pain. He was again alone.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>TESTS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I suppose now we&#8217;ll all get blown up, or poisoned,
or something,&#8221; Bill said to Tony, after
telling of the eclipse of Luigi Malatesta.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; the Malatesta are foemen worthy of
our steel, to agree by an English poet; is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Foeman worthy of a steal,&#8217; I guess you
mean,&#8221; laughed Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s more like it. I wouldn&#8217;t trust that
pig-faced villain across a ten-acre lot with a ten-cent
piece!&#8221; declared Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The soul of honor doesn&#8217;t dwell in a husky
guy who&#8217;d strike a cripple,&#8221; said Gus. &#8220;And I
bet a cow he&#8217;s going to stir up more trouble
around here before he quits maneuvering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tony made no reply, but stood for a long time,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
gazing at the floor. Presently only the sound of
tools and machines was heard in the shop.
</p>
<p>It is not probable that Luigi told of the precise
outcome of his clash with Bill and Gus, though
he may have said enough to influence sophomore
sentiment against Bill&#8217;s standing in the
school. At any rate, the feeling grew in strength
and spread until it became a subject of comment
among freshmen and seniors who were inclined
to sympathize with the brainy and keen-witted
lame boy. At least he had many friends, both
high and low, and most of the teachers admired
him openly.
</p>
<p>So far the sentiment had been rather more
doubtful and erratic than determined. There had
been nothing to warrant the assumption that Bill
thought himself more intelligent than the sophomores,
or members of his own class. His radio
knowledge was somewhat a thing apart and in
that he shared with the less obtrusive Gus.
</p>
<p>And then the lightning struck, suddenly and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
hard. Once each week an outsider from the engineering
department of some big industrial plant,
or large university, lectured to the entire student
body of the Marshallton Tech in the assembly-room,
and there were some of these talkers who
got much pleasure out of it. Not only was it interesting
to hold forth to a lot of eager, responsive
boys on subjects that elicited their curiosity, as
the building of great dams and bridges, the tunneling
under mountains, the erection of mighty
machines, but it was also diverting to hear their
various comments which also led to a comparative
estimate of their understanding.
</p>
<p>Davidson, chief mechanical engineer of a great
mill building corporation, was especially interested
in the personal equation concerning the students,
particularly after Bill Brown bad asked
him a lot of questions, some of which he had replied
to rather lamely. Even more as a matter of
getting back at this young investigator who sat
with a crutch held before him and regarded these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
replies with a smile than for the desire to measure
minds, Davidson gathered a few catch problems
that were stumpers, and upon his third visit, after
talking awhile he switched off on the subject of
problems, short cuts to solutions and then put a
question, looking hard at Bill, as though uttering
a challenge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, how would you go about it,&#8221; he shot
at his audience, &#8220;if you were asked to measure
the cubic contents of an electric light bulb?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A number of smiles greeted the question; these
may have been from lads mostly in the advanced
courses who knew the trick. The lecturer asked
for hands to be raised by those who thought they
could do it, and noting with satisfaction that the
crippled boy was not among the number who responded,
he began hearing them, one at a time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Measure it outside and allow for the thickness
of the glass,&#8221; said one fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about the carbon inside?&#8221; asked
Davidson.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Break the glass and measure the loop,&#8221; called
out a soph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of you would go at it in that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A number of hands went up, some rather reluctantly,
as though their owners scented a trick.
</p>
<p>Davidson still eyed the cripple. &#8220;How would
you do it?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Bill shook his head and said, &#8220;It is that old
trick of Edison&#8217;s and it&#8217;s dead easy. I guess a
good many of our fellows know about it. You
simply punch a hole in the bulb, fill it with water,
pour it back and measure the water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s right. It is really the only sure
way,&#8221; said the man, his manner showing disappointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it isn&#8217;t, begging your pardon. Oh, no,
not the only way,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, how else&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put water in a graduated glass, stick the bulb
in up to the plaster seal and note the increase.
Then break the glass and the carbon and put that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
in separately, deducting the last amount from the
first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Davidson scratched his head. &#8220;Yes; that would
do it, of course, too, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said the other was the only way,&#8221;
insisted Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, the only quick and sure way. Of
course, there are other methods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have to disagree with you, but my
method is just as sure and quicker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might do&mdash;it might do! You seem to be
ready with short cuts in mechanics. How would
you quickly divide a board seventeen and three-eighths
inches wide into five equal parts? Can
anyone here do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, how about this one? If a pint
cup&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your question about dividing the board is too
interesting to pass over so hastily,&#8221; interrupted
Professor Search. &#8220;If you will pardon me, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
would suggest that Brown go to the board and
demonstrate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you let Grier do it? He knows that old
trick, and he is handier with the chalk than I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus went forward, took a two-foot rule from
his pocket and laying off two parallel lines seventeen
and three-eighths inches apart, laid the rule
diagonally across them so that the space would
measure twenty inches. Then he ticked off at the
figures four, eight, twelve and sixteen. Laying
the rule straight across from an outer line to the
first tick he turned and announced:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Each space is practically three and fifteen-thirty-seconds
inches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This brought forth something like applause,
along with many very audible remarks, such as:
&#8220;Pretty cute.&#8221; &#8220;Handy.&#8221; &#8220;Where&#8217;d he get it?&#8221;
&#8220;Can&#8217;t fool either of &#8217;em, can you?&#8221; &#8220;Those
fellows are practical, that&#8217;s sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Davidson smiled sort of absently. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
to give approval, but dropped the question rather
abruptly, going back to his last problem.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see if you can tell me this: I have a half-pint
cup even full of water, the liquid exactly level
with the edge of the glass. About how many one-inch
brads must I drop into the cup before the
water overflows? Water, you understand&mdash;not
oil, nor molasses. This is an old experiment and
it concerns a well-known physical law. If anyone
has seen it done he will kindly remain silent. Now,
who will make a guess as to the number of nails?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every brow was wrinkled, except those of a few
conclusion jumpers of whom there must be some
in every crowd. One of these latter fellows
shouted at once: &#8220;About a half dozen and it&#8217;ll
slop over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take only one or two,&#8221; said another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than a dozen, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the others, mostly lads capable of real mental
exercise, were all cudgeling their brains. It
was a subject which had much to be taken into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
consideration. Presently one senior spoke up:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to take more than an ounce of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly as much, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More. That&#8217;ll fool you mightily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as though a few brads would do it, but
it will take a lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; asked Mr. Davidson. &#8220;Come,
what do you say about this?&#8221; He again appealed
to Bill, turning then also to Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I think I can see that it will take
nearly all of that box of brads, perhaps a hundred.
It is a matter of cohesion and even water possesses
that, so that to overflow, it will have to rise a good
deal above the rim. The area of the glass plus the
rise that will be required for the overflow will be,
in solid contents, easily as much as that box of
loosely filled brads; if they were melted down
they wouldn&#8217;t be greater than the water area. It
is a good deal like the loading of a boat: the displacement
is a uniform, compact mass; the load is
a jumble with more air space than material. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
it is like the floating of a heavy iron pot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For answer the lecturer turned and drew a half-pint
of water in a glass, brought from his pocket
a box of brads and began dropping, one at a time
and counting, them into the water. There was
profound silence. As the number increased,
reaching above two score of the small nails, there
began to be heard comments here and there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Zowie! Who&#8217;d a thunk it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better just dump &#8217;em all in and start over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reckon those nails are soaking the water
up; eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were molasses you could fill it half full
of brads before it would slop over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look, he&#8217;s up to sixty! Would you believe
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey there, Fatty, you guessed one nail; didn&#8217;t
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty-eight, sixty-nine, seventy; looks to me
like a spill pretty soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the freshet starts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll drown a lot of people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Davidson stopped dropping the nails into
the tumbler and held up his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it goes, boys&mdash;the first drop over!
Eighty-two brads. You can see who guessed best.
The cohesion of the liquid explains it, as our
young friend here has said. I&#8217;m glad you have
one thinker among you. Now I want to tell you
something about the installation of machinery by
individual motors driven by a central generator,
as compared to the drive from a mill long countershaft
and pulleys.&#8221; And he proceeded with his
talk.
</p>
<p>Yes, the lightning had struck. From this moment
the respect shown to Bill, and to Gus also,
by those who had no desire to do otherwise was
really almost overdone, his classmates being generally
proud of him, and the teachers and seniors
pleased to have him a member of the school. But
the sophs mostly grew more inclined to consider
both boys a menace to their peace of mind.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>QUICK WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I must have to report to you the utter spoil
of your shop and your work; also my own complete!&#8221;
Such was the breath-taking remark of
Tony Sabaste, as he stuck his head into the room
of Bill and Gus and regarded the boys at their
studies soon after daylight.
</p>
<p>With no more than a word of surprise or doubt
the young mechanics followed their Italian friend
into the basement and were not long in finding his
words true.
</p>
<p>The crown plate of the drill had been broken in
two with a hammer and probably the same means
had been used to crack the lathe pulley and smash
some of the tools. Materials were not harmed,
but the work just begun on two new radio sets of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the better value, along with Tony&#8217;s efforts, was
reduced to splinters.
</p>
<p>The door of the shop had never been locked;
the miscreant had entered in the night and engaged
in the work of destruction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; began Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, say not that question,&#8221; said Tony. &#8220;Do
not you know? Is there a doubt; even one? I
have no enemy in the school but one, and who
else&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure, anyone but friendly, innocent Bill
would know. Malatesta, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus was ready with short cuts to names as well
as to problems, his genius for detection having
been proved in a like instance, before this. He
went over and picked up a hammer, holding it by
the head and scanning the handle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, I suppose, are some thumb prints,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;it only remains for us to get hold of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus was interrupted by the sudden entrance of
a member of the senior class, Jim Lambert, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
had but a few days before completed a crystal
radio set in the shop. He gazed about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About as I thought. This is rotten, fellows,
and if I know anything, it is going to be paid
for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will&mdash;?&#8221; began Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you. I room right above here, as
you know. Late last night, very late, probably
toward morning, I was wakened by a noise. I
listened and heard the sound of a blow that was
surely down here. Then I heard some more noises,
muffled, though,&mdash;the floor, you know, is fire-proofed
and thick. I didn&#8217;t wake Smith, but I
got up and went to the door and looked out. I
hadn&#8217;t been there two minutes before I was aware
that someone came up out of the basement and
was standing in the hall. I think he must have
suspected something, for he came along toward
my door and I got inside and closed it, with my
hand on the knob so as not to click the latch.
Then I felt a pressure on the door&mdash;the fellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
had the nerve to try it. He wanted to see if it
was open, probably thinking it was left ajar and
he may have seen the light from the window,
pulled it open then and there he was&mdash;pretty much
through the door before I closed it. Well, I just
surprised, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, who?&#8221; from Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Malatesta, of course,&#8221; said Gus, with
positive finality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, young fellow, you&#8217;ve got it. Good
guesser. He must have some grudge against&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What said he? How explain?&#8221; demanded
Tony, visibly excited, his dark eyes glittering with
wrath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. Just grinned and turned away as
cool as a glacier and mosied off. Said I: &#8216;Well,
what are you after?&#8217; But he made no reply and
beat it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this isn&#8217;t the limit!&#8221; Bill exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be his limit! Come on! The Doctor is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
an early riser and we&#8217;ll see him at once,&#8221; Lambert
urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we aren&#8217;t going to squeal on a&mdash;&#8221; Bill&#8217;s
loyalty to school practices was extreme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes you are in this case! This is no prank.
It&#8217;s a crime, and it would be another to keep it to
myself. Loyalty to the school demands that we
squeal. To be sure we have only circumstantial
evidence&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, actual,&#8221; said Gus, holding up the hammer.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the man and we&#8217;ll do the rest
with some ink, a piece of paper and a magnifying
glass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory! That&#8217;s the cheese! I never thought
of that,&#8221; Lambert said, leading the way out of the
building and to the office, discussing the case further
on the way. The boys met the Doctor returning
from an early morning walk, which was
a habit with him, and within the office he heard
Lambert&#8217;s report calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot call in any of the teachers, or the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
janitor, as hardly anyone is up yet. We shall
have to handle the case without gloves and depend
on you boys. You will understand my position, so
I will ask you, Lambert, to bring Malatesta here at
once, saying I wish to see him. Wake him, if
need be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he refuses at this hour?&#8221; asked the
senior.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But will he, if it is at my request?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely. I know him. Rage, scare, ugly,
even knife; no telling!&#8221; Tony declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we had better wait for the janitor. Go
call him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Doctor, please,&#8221; urged Gus. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go with
Lambert and we&#8217;ll fetch him here. And he won&#8217;t
hurt anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But can you be sure of this? We always try
to avoid publicity in matters of this kind. It
would be best to have Malatesta here this early,
before most of the boys are up and about, but
there must be no trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure there will be no trouble,&#8221;
Gus insisted. &#8220;Bill can tell you why. It&#8217;s really
quite simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at least call on Malatesta and tell him.
I will call the janitor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus and Lambert hastened away. Bill, also
eager to have the Sicilian apprehended at once,
and knowing Gus would put it over, sought to
detain the Doctor. Tony, like-minded, aided in
this. In a few minutes Lambert was knocking on
Malatesta&#8217;s door, Gus having gone to his own
room.
</p>
<p>There was no response at first; then, a sleepy
grunt. The time was yet an hour or more before
the first rising bell, so this early summons might
properly be resented. But when Lambert called
in a low voice: &#8220;I have a message from Doctor
Field,&#8221; the Italian&#8217;s roommate, Johnston, a
morose, dull-witted chap whose whole mind was
bent on keeping up with his classes, made reply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you want?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Both of you,&#8221; said Lambert, which was true,
for he knew he could not enter without seeing
Johnston also.
</p>
<p>At that Johnston got up, opened the door and
Lambert entered, in his hand a paper which he
made a pretense of consulting, as though it were a
memorandum of his errand, his real purpose being
to hold off until Gus appeared. Somehow the
senior had faith in this quiet, smiling, precise
freshman.
</p>
<p>Then Gus came swiftly along the hall and
through the room door, advancing near the bed
still occupied by the Italian. Lambert, rather
inclined to dodge trouble, stepped back a little.
Said Gus:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Malatesta, Doctor Field wants to see you at
once. He wants no fuss, Johnston, he said, so
please let on to know nothing about it. Come on!&#8221;&mdash;this
to the Sicilian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What to see me about?&#8221; demanded the Italian,
angrily. &#8220;Well, I will presently see him&mdash;go tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
him that! It is not yet the time for school. I
am yet wishing to sleep a little. Good day to
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You get up and into your duds! This is no
joke.&#8221; Gus advanced a step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who are you to so order of me? Get out
of this room!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, you! If you don&#8217;t slide out of there
in about three shakes we&#8217;ll drag you out and take
you up as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Malatesta got out, but not in the spirit of obedience
demanded of him. He tossed the bed clothes
aside and, to the astonishment of all three beholders,
proved to be fully dressed, excepting his coat
and shoes. With his feet on the floor, he quickly
reached behind him and drew forth a long-bladed
clasp-knife, flinging it open with the dexterity of
long practice. But Gus was quicker. In two seconds
the fellow was staring into the muzzle of a
revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it up if you don&#8217;t want to look like a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
sieve. Now, then, shoes. Coat. And put down
that knife. That&#8217;s right. Now move!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Malatesta was not equal to any further braggadocio.
Intuition goes far at such times, and
there seemed to be something about this holder of
the more powerful weapon that demanded respect.
The fellow hardly gave a second glance at the gun,
but stepped into his shoes. Without stopping to
lace them, he grabbed his coat and got into it as
he headed for the door. The march to the school
office, single file, Luigi, Gus and Lambert in the
order named, was as silent as it was hasty, Gus
thrusting the pistol, a real one this time and
loaded, into his pocket as they went. Nor did he
need to draw it again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Luigi Malatesta, I am sorry to have been compelled
to bring you here at this hour,&#8221; said the
president, &#8220;but you are suspected of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! But me it was not! Yet I know
who, though to tell I shall never do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know? Were you present, then,
when the injury was done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not present, but I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must tell us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the way of the school to blow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, please, Doctor, but we won&#8217;t get
anywhere this way,&#8221; interposed Bill when Gus
nudged him. &#8220;If I may suggest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The president had come to regard this boy as
possessing ideas and he hesitated. Bill turned
to Gus who stood with the hammer and a magnifying
glass held behind him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please have this man,&#8221; said Bill, indicating
the Italian, &#8220;make a print of his thumb&mdash;this
way.&#8221; Bill smeared some ink on a blotter and
took up a bit of white paper. Malatesta frowned,
then smirked, then laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not may I?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;This
will make of these villains fools!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>The animal-like snarl that the Sicilian put into
this last sentence did not gain him any sympathy,
but there was only confidence in his quick motions
and ready compliance. He stepped to the
desk, pressed his thumb on the wet ink spot, then
on the white paper, fell back a few steps and
glared defiantly. Gus brought forth the hammer
and the expression on Malatesta&#8217;s face changed
somewhat.
</p>
<p>Silence followed as the Doctor took up the hammer
handle and went over it with the magnifying-glass,
paused at a spot where the handle would be
most commonly held and examined the surface
long and carefully. He turned to the thumb-print
on the paper, then back again to the handle, comparing
the two impressions. Presently he glanced
at Bill and then at Gus, nodding; he turned to
Malatesta.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not wish to let such an unfortunate circumstance
as this become hurtful to the school by
making it public. The janitor will be here in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
moment. He will accompany you to your room
and you will obtain your property and leave at
once. When you return this way I shall give you
the sum paid us for your tuition. The school will
make good the damage you caused. Ah, here is
Royce now.&#8221; The president proceeded to instruct
the janitor.
</p>
<p>Lambert, followed by Bill and Gus, returned at
once to the dormitory, after a word of caution
from Doctor Field, and, aside from the fact that
Malatesta left before the school was fully awake,
the students knew nothing.
</p>
<p>The injury to the shop was kept as secret as
possible. In a few days the work went on as before,
only one other fellow besides Lambert knowing
there had been a smash-up. So that incident
was closed, but out of it, or as a part of it, more
serious circumstances showed that Malatesta,
wherever he may have gone, had by no means forgotten
the feud that now included Bill and Gus
as well as Tony.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>Gus was never questioned as to his possession
of a revolver which made his wild west method of
intimidating Malatesta possible. Probably the
Doctor believed the cigar case had been used
again.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>FISTICUFFS</h3>
</div>

<p>Siebold, a keen-witted fellow and an athlete,
was the leading spirit among the sophomores of
Marshallton Tech. He was class president, stood
easily at the head of his classes, if head there was,
and in most things he admittedly surpassed his
fellows. His people being well-to-do, he indulged
in all the little &#8220;side kicks,&#8221; as the boys termed
sports, social diversions and the like.
</p>
<p>A really fine chap was Siebold, though he possessed
one unfortunate failing&mdash;he persisted in
holding to a grudge; and he had never forgiven
Bill and Gus for that hazing fiasco, nor for bringing
down the scorn of the school on what had
been considered a harmless kind of fun.
</p>
<p>Of course, the school had a debating society, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
which the membership was from all classes. Bill
joined it; Gus did not, and it was the only thing in
which they acted separately, with the exception of
the gymnasium. Bill was sorry he had joined the
society, for upon being chosen one of the three
speakers on one side of a subject so decidedly in
their favor that the question should never have
been selected as offering a negative, Bill had so
completely overcome the opposition led by Siebold,
who especially prided himself as a debater,
that his opponent and his mates were held up to
much ridicule. Whereupon the breach widened,
and Siebold took many occasions to show a paltry
spite against Bill and even toward Gus because he
was Bill&#8217;s chum.
</p>
<p>In the gym, Siebold also shone as a good boxer,
fencer and wrestler. This rarely brought him
into contact with Gus who, during his short exercise,
avoided others. Tony, however, was willing
to become a victim. The young Italian liked to
put on the gloves, as he was quick, strong and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
good-natured; but the instructor had, for some
reason known only to himself, passed him by.
</p>
<p>Late one afternoon Gus stopped pulling weights
to watch Siebold box with a big soph who was a
mark for quick, scientific work and whose heavy
punches and swings often fell short of their aim.
Tony also was an interested spectator and came
forward with the request that Siebold show him
some of the points he had mastered. Whereupon
Siebold had the Italian lad put on the gloves with
Sadler and the big fellow promptly hit Tony and
knocked him off his feet.
</p>
<p>The Italian&#8217;s dark eyes flashed fire, but he
smiled and came back. The instructor refused to
let the bout continue, saying that Tony must gain
more experience. Gus called Tony over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to butt in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t
like that. You could learn that game. Would
you mind if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you show me? Everything you do so
verra good.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Tony was so eager that Gus consented. They
agreed to come to the gym at a time when no one,
not even the instructor, was there. Then, in addition,
Tony bought a set of gloves so that the two
could practice in the shop now and then. A month
went by. Cold weather came; then the Christmas
holidays. Bill and Gus went home for the one big
day, and came back to study and to continue their
shop work; but Tony was away for ten days, during
which he took a few lessons from one of the
best teachers of the fistic art that could be found.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I am now there,&#8221; gleefully announced
Tony when the three got together again; &#8220;and
that I can learn one poco, for I did puncha him
times several and he no hit me sempra. I think
you,&#8221; his dark eyes appraised Gus, &#8220;are quite&mdash;no,
I not throw bouquets&mdash;are gooda as he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not so good as Ben Duffy? I know all
about him. I went once with my city uncle to see
him fight. He&#8217;s a crackerjack, sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he not poka me more as you do,&#8221; argued
Tony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been studying your defense longer&mdash;it&#8217;s
mine too, you know. That&#8217;s the reason.&#8221;
The generous Gus smiled. &#8220;Anyway, let&#8217;s go to
the gym to-morrow. I want to see how you mix
it up now with Sadler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tony did &#8220;mix it up&#8221; much to Sadler&#8217;s discomfort.
Siebold stepped up:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Italy, where did you get it?&#8221; And Tony,
proud, ever eager to give credit to a friend, nodded
toward Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To him I do owe it. He one granda master
with the feest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So? Expert electrician, mechanic, sport
spoiler and bruiser, eh? Some combination.&#8221;
And Siebold turned away with something too
much like a sneer on his fine face. Gus was hurt,
but smiled, as usual. Tony resented the slur.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For all which,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the cervel&mdash;the
brain, is required, eh? Maybe, Soph, if you brain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
ancora had you could beata heem&mdash;but no so
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No? I&#8217;ll bet a sardine that you could put it
all over him,&#8221; Siebold said, desiring to mollify an
upper classman. Tony laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not coulda you ancora, nor any other one
in this school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Siebold turned away, as he added: &#8220;You won&#8217;t
have a chance to prove that. I pick my company.
But you will get another go at Sadler after I give
him some more pointers.&#8221; It was evident that
the leader among the sophomores was something
of a snob. A little later his prediction came true
regarding Sadler and Tony.
</p>
<p>Gus was again a witness to the bout. It had
become noised around and the gym held a goodly
crowd of students. At such times the instructor,
though interested and often a witness, dodged
participation because of the slugging tendency
and its possible effect on the school if he encouraged
such a thing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Tony went into the game with a smile. Sadler,
though generally good-natured, was serious and
determined from the start. He got a number of
stinging cracks on his ribs and in the stomach,
Tony hardly being able to reach his head. Beaten
again at points, landed on five times as often as
he landed, he began to resort to a waiting game,
for there was no doubt he could stand punishment.
Stand it he did until Tony got enough confidence
for infighting, though he should never have attempted
to swap punches with such a big fellow.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Sadler caught the smaller man starting
a short arm upper cut for the jaw and he took
it open, delivering at the same instant a hook that
no man when giving a blow could hope to block.
He caught Tony coming in and that lent additional
momentum to the blow which got Tony on the side
of the neck, over the artery, and it was as clean a
knock-out as could be given. They carried the
Italian to a wrestling mat, fanned and bathed his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
face, and when he came to and sat up, Siebold was
there with his ready tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too heavy for you. No fellow could hope
to stand up to Sadler at his own game. I told
you so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus saw Tony&#8217;s real hurt and was incensed.
&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you believe that,&#8221; he said to Tony.
&#8220;Another time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, fellow! Maybe you think you could
stand up to Sadler. I&#8217;d like to see you, or anyone
here, even the instructor.&#8221; He glanced around.
&#8220;Could they, Mr. Gay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps not. Sadler has the punch and
you can&#8217;t hurt him,&#8221; said the instructor, coming
up. &#8220;Feel all right now, Sabaste?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was said about another bout, but
the subject stirred the crowd so that it could not
die out entirely. Three or four days later the
instructor and Siebold entered the gym together,
and stopped to watch Gus punching the bag. Siebold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
had never seen anything quite so snappy as
that. Mr. Gay made some remarks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow must have had some instructions
under a strong teacher&mdash;there&#8217;s good material
there! Say, look at the way he plays a tattoo and
swings, too, and gets away from it. Foot work,
my boy&mdash;foot work! You&#8217;re good, Siebold, but
we haven&#8217;t anything like that in the school. I had
no idea of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! All the same I&#8217;d like to see him swap
cracks with Sadler,&#8221; said Siebold doggedly. Just
at that instant Sadler came lumbering in with a
dozen other fellows at his heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not start anything rough,&#8221; cautioned
Mr. Gay.
</p>
<p>But Siebold paid no heed. He walked over to
Gus and addressed him roughly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, would you have the nerve to fight Sadler?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight? Fight? Why, man, I have no reason
to. I haven&#8217;t anything against him.&#8221; Gus was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
indignant. &#8220;And as to boxing bouts, I&#8217;m not in
this game. Too busy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! One way to whitewash a little streak
of yellow.&#8221; This with a sneer.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the kindly smile on Gus&#8217;s manly face
faded out. He stepped quickly in front of Siebold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say that to me! I&#8217;ll fight you here
and now; bare knuckles if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Gay overheard the conversation and came
back to the boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you want to
have a friendly bout with the gloves, all right&mdash;even
to a finish&mdash;but no bad blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus turned away. So did Siebold. Sadler, who
was tired of being punched at Siebold&#8217;s request,
would prefer to do a little looking on. With satisfaction
he saw Mr. Gay take his hat and leave
the building. The instructor may have seen a
scrap on the way and wished to evade responsibility.
He was anxious to be popular with the
boys.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Sadler offered a few suggestions. Immediately
several boys surrounded good-natured Gus and
shoved him into the open center of the room. Then
they did the same to Siebold, but with more verbal
persuasiveness and in a moment the two were
facing each other, and a pair of boxing-gloves was
handed to each.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>LOYALTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The freshman&#8217;s smile had returned, and he
stood with the gloves swinging by the strings from
his hand. Siebold, who really was no piker, was
slipping on his gloves and having them laced up.
Gus wished Bill to talk for him&mdash;and Tony too&mdash;not
that he needed moral support, but it was
pleasanter to have good friends along than to be
entirely surrounded by opponents. However, he
felt quite equal to the physical task, and as ready
to stand his ground morally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, you sophs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll box and
gladly, but not in the way Siebold wants to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, what do you care how the other fellow
feels? It&#8217;s a bout just the same; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Gay doesn&#8217;t want us to show any hard
feelings,&#8221; Gus urged, &#8220;and he&#8217;s decent to us. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
don&#8217;t believe Siebold really thinks I&#8217;m yellow&mdash;<i>do</i>
you?&#8221;&mdash;this last to his intended opponent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; growled Siebold, showing more
indignation than he really felt. Had he permitted
himself to use his reason, he would only have
admired Gus and would not have quarreled with
him. Probably it was nothing more than an uneasy
conscience that now asserted itself and made
him add, in self-defense: &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re yellow
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus had but one reply to make to that&mdash;and his
answer was not verbal. He did not again take his
eyes from Siebold, but he pulled on the gloves,
laced the right one with the clumsy stuffed thumb
and his teeth. Then he stepped forward. Siebold
made a feint of extending his hand for the customary
shake; but Gus ignored it and the next
moment the two were at it in a way that showed
clearly the desire to hurt each other and to disregard
the mere matter of points. It was a slugging
match from the first.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Siebold was no mean antagonist, and he had
some tricks worthy of the prize ring. Moreover,
he was a little taller, a little heavier and had a
longer reach than Grier. Immediately it became
apparent that he was trying for a knock-out&mdash;he
meant to put Gus away and to do it as quickly as
possible.
</p>
<p>But Gus did not mean to be put out, and it became
as quickly evident that he was quite capable
of making Siebold work hard even to hit him. Siebold
would bore in, drive for the jaw or stomach,
and either miss or land lightly; but he would
nearly always get a stinging crack in return&mdash;delivered
at the same instant that his own blow was
blocked, or in the fraction of a second after he had
only struck the empty air. Still, these blows of
Gus&#8217;s were not paralyzers&mdash;they were just weakeners.
They made Siebold angry enough to spend
his strength in getting back at the chap who could
land in just when and where he wished.
</p>
<p>Siebold&#8217;s nose ached and bled; his eyes smarted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and one was closing. His stomach, too, was sore,
and somehow he could not help but feel that his
blows were growing futile. At the end of the fifth
round, as he sat back on a bench, letting some of
his would-be handlers fan and sponge him, he
looked across at Gus, standing there, refusing all
half-hearted offers of attention and gazing at him
with a smile on his unmarked face, the sophomore
champion began to wish he had not got into this
fuss. Then he grew furious at the thought that
he was not making good.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later, near the end of the sixth
round, he began to try for clinches in order to save
himself, but somehow his wary opponent, as quick
on his feet and as strong with his hands as he was
at the start, was still adept at hitting and getting
away. Just then Sadler, who, with watch in hand,
always made a little step forward as he called the
end of each round, put out his foot when Siebold
was facing him and the sophomore, tired and
eager for a minute&#8217;s respite, started to get back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and lowered his guard. And upon the instant
of shouting the word Gus, with his back to Sadler,
let go with his right.
</p>
<p>Siebold crumpled up like a rag. Sadler, slow to
begin counting, stood over him a moment. Gus
drew back and with the first excitement he had
shown jerked his gloves off and tossed them wide.
The boys crowded in, gazing at Siebold who lay
with white face and sprawled out like one dead.
Gus heard Sadler&#8217;s count reach eight; then stop.
Someone said: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him,
boys?&#8221; They had not seen a fellow lie so still
and show not even the flicker of an eyelid. One
boy stooped down and lifted Siebold&#8217;s arm, calling
to him: &#8220;Wake up! Are you hurt?&#8221; A doctor&#8217;s
son got down and put his ear to Siebold&#8217;s
heart. &#8220;Gosh, fellows! It&#8217;s stopped! He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s
dead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus pushed the boys aside. He had hit Siebold
over the heart harder than he had intended. What
if the blow had proved fatal? Most unlikely; more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
than once he himself had been struck that way.
It had hurt him, and once it brought him to his
knees, but it had never made him unconscious.
He, in turn, got down and put his ear to Siebold&#8217;s
side. In the excitement both the doctor&#8217;s son and
Gus had listened at the right side and no one had
observed the mistake. They were all looking on
with horrified faces. Gus could hear nothing; he
touched the prostrate youth&#8217;s cheek; it was cold.
He rose with something like a sob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellows, I didn&#8217;t mean to do it. I didn&#8217;t know
he couldn&#8217;t stand it. But he can&#8217;t really be much
hurt, can he? Why, I&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Gus knelt and listened for heart beats.
He slumped down, feeling as though his own heart
would stop, too. In his daze he heard someone
talking on the telephone at the far end of the gym
and dimly distinguished the word &#8220;doctor.&#8221; He
got to his feet then. No one opposed him. He
must get Bill, good old Bill, to speak for him and
tell them that he had not meant to hurt Siebold.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
They must know he was not murderously inclined,
and that he hated to hurt anyone, anything, an
animal, a bug even; also that he would not run
away if they wanted to arrest him.
</p>
<p>In a sort of trance he reached his room, where
he found Bill and Tony. Gus fell into a chair,
almost sobbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill, old fellow,&mdash;we boxed,&mdash;Siebold! And I&mdash;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I
guess I&#8217;ve killed him! I didn&#8217;t mean to,
Bill, you know that. Tell them I didn&#8217;t; that I&#8217;ll
be here and go to prison without a word. And
write home, Bill, and tell them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stuff!&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!
Tony will go see about it. At the gym, Gus? Yes,
at the gym,&#8221; nodding to the Italian.
</p>
<p>Tony was gone. Bill stood by Gus, his hand
on his chum&#8217;s head. Seldom was there any real
show at tenderness between these lads, but there
was a loyalty there that made such a demonstration
unnecessary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so, Gus&mdash;and even if it should be&mdash;anybody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
knows it was an accident, and you won&#8217;t
be arrested. At least not in a criminal way&mdash;only
in the matter of form. The president will understand.
And, Gus, we can get together money
enough to defend you&mdash;legally&mdash;even though we
have to quit school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> sha&#8216;n&#8217;t quit school!&#8221; said Gus. &#8220;Not if I
have to do time! No, sir! It doesn&#8217;t matter much
about me, but you&mdash;you&#8217;re not to be in this at all,
except I don&#8217;t want us ever to be not chums, Bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rapid footsteps were coming along the hall
then; the door opened and Tony and Sadler burst
into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right, Grier. He&#8217;s come to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>mio amico</i>; Siebold, this Sadler say, is
again recover. You no need longer to fear. But,
ah! They tell it to me that he a sight presents.
He will go to his classes the observed. And it
serves him all the right; is it not so? And the
most to do is to explain the Doctor for you&mdash;which
we all do.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ONE WINTER SATURDAY</h3>
</div>

<p>Marshallton is a village with nothing more
than two general stores sufficient to cater to the
needs of the near neighborhood and the Tech
students. Guilford, nine miles away, is the railroad
town and, now and then, for extra supplies
the Tech boys may spend a dull half hour each
way on the trolley to visit the quiet place which
holds no other attraction than the stores.
</p>
<p>Bill, Gus and Tony, eager to get some radio
supplies that might as well have been ordered
from the city, obtained leave to run over to Guilford
and back. To show his appreciation of their
friendship, Tony decided to treat Bill and Gus to
a taxi ride; so he &#8217;phoned to the town for one.
It came and the three piled in, much elated over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the prospect of a pleasant shopping trip, though
the weather was a little stormy.
</p>
<p>The purchasing took all that was left of the
morning. The boys gathered their things into
bundles and, at Tony&#8217;s command, made straightway
for a restaurant. Being a senior, he claimed
entire charge of these freshmen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You not respon&mdash;no; it is that you are irresponsible,&#8221;
he said as he demanded the privilege
of paying all expenses. &#8220;We will get,&#8221; he laughed,
&#8220;some spaghetti and I show you to eat. You like
eet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did. The clean tables and pleasant interior
were attractive. The boys stamped the newly
fallen snow from their feet, and opened their coats
to the genial warmth. Then they turned to meet
the waiter and glanced up with something of a
shock. Luigi Malatesta stood before them and
addressed them collectively:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proprietor of this. We serve only gentlemen.
You will go to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;elsewhere.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>Gus leaped up, forgetting the fright after his
last fisticuffs. He wanted to punch this villain
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, you confounded nuisance! This is a
public place and we demand&mdash;&#8221; He got no further,
for Tony&#8217;s hand was on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Attendate, <i>mio amico</i>&mdash;wait! Would you eat
eats in a such place? We might all getta the poison
here. Mucho better we go of our selves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Malatesta beat a hasty retreat. The lads went
out and along the street to another place equally
attractive and there they ate unsparingly, the
while discussing their latest experience, though
Tony was silent on that. Finally Bill and Gus
fell into his mood. They came out of the restaurant
after an hour, to find that the storm had
increased, a stiff, knife-edged wind driving the
snow horizontally and making drifts. The taxi
driver at the garage looked dubious, but agreed
to try for Marshallton. The worst that could
happen would be a night spent at some farmhouse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>The storm increased rapidly, the snow turning
partly to sleet piled up in long windrows across
all half-sheltered places, leaving open spots bare,
so that the road resembled the storm waves of a
white and foaming ocean. The car skidded along
on icy ground one minute, and the next its wheels
were buried in caked drifts.
</p>
<p>The boys were peering out, watching the strange
effects of the storm, but noting with greater concern
the slowing up of the taxi. Then they
stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon we can&#8217;t make it,&#8221; said the jolly,
round-faced taxi driver. They could not stay
there in the road. It was imperative that they
should find a shelter somewhere. Not half a mile
ahead there was a farmhouse in which they might
all be made welcome and comfortable.
</p>
<p>Again the man had proved to be correct. The
boys agreed that forecasting the weather and the
social geography of that region were in his line.
He tried to run on again, but the starter refused
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
to boost the engine and the battery nearly gave
out. Bill insisted that they crank up and not
exhaust the battery, else they would come to a
dead stop. Gus and Tony lent a hand in turning
the engine over and soon they were again bucking
the drifts, stalling the engine two or three times
within the next three hundred yards. A drift faced
them that was altogether beyond hope, and before
they drove into it, Bill insisted that they back
over the thinner snow to the side of the road so
that they would not be hit by another car if one
should pull through such roads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, you fellows!&#8221; said Bill, as usual
assuming command where anything important
was at stake. &#8220;Go on to the farmhouse and bunk,
if they&#8217;ll have you. I&#8217;ll wrap up in these robes
and be as warm as toast here in the car.&#8221; It was
an enclosed tonneau, the window sashes fitted
tightly and two big robes promised a little comfort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>you will</i>,&#8221; said Gus sarcastically.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Not!</i>&#8221; declared Tony. &#8220;We can easy carry
you. You say it&mdash;pig-on-back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The taxi driver joined in and helped the two
boys in this, also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say there&#8217;s a farmhouse just on
ahead, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; asked Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Merritt is my name,&#8221; answered the driver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a roadside is your station. You&#8217;re fast in
the snow and you cannot go and you&#8217;re mad at all
creation,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, son, about bein&#8217; stuck, but I ain&#8217;t
mad. Reckon I stand to lose on this trip, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my friend; you will not lose one cent,&#8221;
exclaimed Tony. &#8220;More, you shall make well.
We are not the unappreciatives, ever. Show us
this farmer estate and entitle us to be his guests
and you shall want for nothing&mdash;eh, my friends
Bill and Gus?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it, Tony, and you are the cheese.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no; I am but the macaroni. Do you think
this farmer will cook the spaghetti?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not likely, but Farrell sits down to a good
table, I reckon,&#8221; Merritt ventured. &#8220;Well, young
fellers, let&#8217;s mosey on. It&#8217;ll be stiff goin&#8217;, though
&#8217;tain&#8217;t more&#8217;n a quarter of a mile now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was stiff going. Bill managed to get through
the thin places and they helped him through fast
increasing drifts, Gus at last getting him on his
back for a &#8220;gain,&#8221; as he expressed it, of fifty
yards. Then Tony took a turn for a like distance,
and Gus and Mr. Merritt crossed hands to &#8220;carry
a lady to London&#8221;; so they would have got Bill
along for a considerable distance had they not
come opposite the end of a lane, with the dim
outline of a house standing back.
</p>
<p>Up the lane they went, hearing the muffled barking
of a dog. The side door of the house opened,
a big farmer with a huge voice greeted them
cheerily. He was in his shirt sleeves, which argued
for comfort inside the dwelling, and there was an
air of comfort in the broad hallway that was
gratifying. The three were received like young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
princes and ushered into a large sitting-room.
From their chairs before a big stove, a pleasant
woman and two young girls rose to welcome the
wayfarers.
</p>
<p>Merritt they knew by name, and he began an
apologetic effort to account for their coming, but
Bill took the matter in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Farrell, aren&#8217;t you? And I suppose this
is Mrs. Farrell. My name is Brown and these are
my friends, Mr. Sabaste and Mr. Grier; we are all
students at Marshallton. Went in to Guilford to
the stores and couldn&#8217;t make it going back, though
Mr. Merritt put up a good fight with his little car.
And now we are going to ask you if you can keep
us for the night,&mdash;table and spare room? Anything
that is handy, for we don&#8217;t want to give you
trouble and we&#8217;ll pay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the best. As if you are one fine hotel,
because no such could give to us more of comfort.&#8221;
This from Tony, who was always most liberal
and eager to please. So saying, he pulled out ten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
one-dollar bills and gallantly tendered it to the
lady, with a nod and smile at the farmer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. The wife has all the trouble.
You boys are welcome; eh, Sarah?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But John, this is too much. I could not accept
such a large amount for so little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said one of the girls, coming forward,
&#8220;you should not accept anything at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, Mary, I guess you&#8217;re right. This
is our daughter, young gentlemen, and she always
has her way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she has not consider the way to justice,&#8221;
said Tony, his black eyes flashing conviction. &#8220;We
give that, or we not remain; even it is too little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, considering the storm, our predicament
and our coming in on you this way, unasked, we
can&#8217;t consent to less,&#8221; Bill added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mabel, come here, girl,&#8221; said the housewife,
laughing. &#8220;This is my niece. She&#8217;s making her
home with us. Now, all you young folks and Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Merritt enjoy yourselves while I get supper and
father does the barn work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys never forgot that long, yet all too short
winter evening; the wholesome food; the dish of
home-made candy; the fireside game of &#8220;twenty
questions&#8221;; the music played by Mabel on the old-fashioned
square piano, while Mary and Tony
danced; the lively conversation and Bill&#8217;s exhibition
of so-called mind reading&mdash;really muscle
reading, during which, with Mrs. Farrell and
Mabel holding his wrists, he found, blindfolded, a
hidden pocket knife.
</p>
<p>Merritt had slipped out early to open the radiator
of his car, which he had foolishly forgotten to
do. He had come back and called Bill aside for a
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another car down the road, just beyond
mine; a big one and nobody about. I went
along apiece to look at it and I think I know who
it belongs to&mdash;that there new Eyetalian hash-house
feller in Guilford. Only one car there like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
it and that&#8217;s his&#8217;n. You was askin&#8217; about him
bein&#8217; in Guilford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We know him and he knows us. He
could have found out you were taking us home and
then have seen your car here and waited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean follered you? What&#8217;d he want to
do&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he still in his car?&#8221; interrupted Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so; think I saw four fellers in it.
They can keep warm there and every now and then
run their engine a bit to keep her from freezin&#8217;
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be drifted in, won&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon not, with a big car like that; and the
storm&#8217;s goin&#8217; to quit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that won&#8217;t let us go on to-night. And
what is that Italian up to?&#8221; Bill dismissed the
subject with Merritt, but resolved to tell Gus,
though not Tony, as it would put a damper on
their friend&#8217;s peace of mind. What harm could
come of Malatesta&#8217;s being here? He could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
approach the house without alarming the Farrell
dog and that was assurance enough. And Bill
could not help being doubtful as to the Sicilian&#8217;s
being really dangerous. There might be such a
thing as carrying this grudge business to extremes,
but hardly here and in this storm.
</p>
<p>Bill and Gus spent the night in the best spare
room, under the heavy covers of an immense fourposter.
They slept through the cold night like
inanimate objects. Tony, alone, occupied a room
which had evidently been that of an only son who
had gone away to the Great War to remain away
forever. There was crape hanging over the frame
of a picture showing a sturdy, manly looking
fellow in khaki. From the appearance of things,
Tony, also, should have passed a comfortable
night. Merritt was tucked away to his entire
satisfaction.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>KIDNAPED</h3>
</div>

<p>In the morning Bill and Gus were up at daylight,
as was their habit. The storm had ceased,
and it was turning warm, the snow melting
already. The boys went to the barn to help with
the milking; they got in some wood and performed
other chores. Mr. Farrell, coming in, declared
with his hearty laugh that they could stay as long
as they might wish to, for they had certainly more
than earned their food and lodging. As they went
in to the breakfast table he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, better give that other young fellow
his money back. Where is he, anyway? Not down
yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Mrs. Farrell, &#8220;though I called
him twice.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him up and down,&#8221; said Gus, going toward
the stairway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, have you seen Gyp?&#8221; asked Mary
Farrell. &#8220;I&#8217;ve called him too, but he doesn&#8217;t
come for his breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The farmer shook his head and, stepping to the
back door, whistled sharply and at length. Turning
to come in he heard a low whine and a quick
search found the dog, lying on his side and unable
to rise, his eyes dull and bloodshot, his tongue
protruding. Mr. Farrell had seen something of
the sort before. He picked up the poor little beast
and carried him to a warm bed by the kitchen
stove.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, he&#8217;s been poisoned! Nothing else.
Getting over it, though. What&mdash;?&#8221; And then
they heard Gus calling from above.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill! Bill! Come up here, quick! Tony&#8217;s
gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was true and the manner of his going was
very apparent. The room had been entered from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
without, noiselessly and by experts. Taking advantage
not only of the lad&#8217;s sleeping soundly,
the housebreakers had used some anæsthetic, for
a wad of cotton that smelled like a drug store lay
on the carpet. Tony had evidently been roughly
dressed. His collar, necktie and cap lay on the
bureau and his stockings on the floor. That he
had been carried out of the window and to the
ground was certain. The two ends of the ladder
had left their imprint in the snow in the sill and
on the ground. The ladder itself had been thrown
among the bushes.
</p>
<p>Kidnaped! There was no question about that;
but how could such a thing have happened? A
sturdy boy, able to put up a fight, and the thing
done so silently as not to waken a soul in the
house. Healthy, sound sleepers, depending on a
dog&mdash;and that poor beast put down and out.
Poor Tony! What would they do with him!
</p>
<p>Bill and Gus hastily related their affair with the
ugly Sicilian and that of which Tony had told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
them. They at once found that the big car had
turned about and gone. Footprints in the snow
proved that the occupants of the car had been the
kidnapers.
</p>
<p>The farmer and his family were duly excited
over the case. Nothing so dramatic had ever before
happened to them. Merritt was also wrought
up to a pretty high pitch, for Tony had hired him
very generously. The young Italian had shown
himself to be a courteous, well-bred gentleman and
had commanded respect. The manner of his disappearance,
and the possible tragedy lurking behind
it, had earned the sympathy of them all.
</p>
<p>But the Farrells deferred everything to Bill
and Gus who were both eager to act, and to investigate
the too evident, yet mysterious crime,
though they were rendered helpless by the snow-piled
roads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to use your &#8217;phone, Mr. Farrell,&#8221;
said Bill. &#8220;We will pay all the tolls. We&#8217;ve got
to make this thing known and put Tony&#8217;s people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
wise. His father&#8217;s a wealthy Italian banker in
the city, and he&#8217;ll begin to move things when he
hears about this.&#8221; He turned to Gus: &#8220;If we
could only get to the school and get a whack at
the transmitter, couldn&#8217;t we make things hum?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my lads,&#8221; said Mr. Farrell, &#8220;that is just
the thing to do and I can get you there in a hurry.
These automobiles have got it all over our horses
for speed, but not for power. My bays will land
you at the school in short order and through the
biggest snow that you ever saw. Wait till I hitch
them up to the Dearborn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was as good as his word. After promising
to keep the Farrells and Merritt posted as to the
progress of the hunt for Tony and its outcome,
they were on the road behind a pair of splendid,
steaming, plunging horses, and soon back at the
Tech. The Doctor, about to depart for church,
was startled by the news, and he at once turned
the transmitting station over to the boys, going
himself to the &#8217;phone and keeping it busy. Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Farrell remained a short time. Then wishing the
boys success, he departed.
</p>
<p>The county detective, the mounted police force,
the city force and a private detective agency were
all informed of the circumstance, with a full description
of Luigi Malatesta. The incident became
a &#8220;nine-days&#8217; wonder&#8221; in the newspapers.
Soon it was learned that the Sicilian had, on the
very day before Tony&#8217;s disappearance, sold his
restaurant in Guilford for a song. He had disappeared
with several others, questionable characters
with whom he had been associated, and on
whom he had evidently relied to do the kidnaping.
It was discovered also, through the confession of
a Sicilian suspect, that Tony had been shadowed
for weeks as he went about the school.
</p>
<p>But all knowledge of the boy&#8217;s whereabouts was
totally lacking. Clues were run down without success.
The search had failed. Mr. Sabaste, with
a famous detective, came to the school and talked
with Bill and Gus. He went with them to see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the Farrells, where he investigated every detail.
The search went far and wide, with no trace of
Tony.
</p>
<p>The banker offered five thousand dollars for
information that would insure his son&#8217;s return,
and smaller sums for any positive data, which
might lead to the arrest of the kidnapers. Tony&#8217;s
mother was dead. An older brother who had been
in business in the far west was once a victim of
the Malatesta clan. In spite of every possible
effort, the disappearance of the boy remained a
mystery; nor could any of the Malatesta relatives,
known by various names and suspected as accomplices,
be found.
</p>
<p>Bill and Gus were now in possession of one of
the finest radio receiving sets that could be made,
and several other students had purchased similar,
or less perfect, sets from the boys. Whenever
opportunity permitted they either had the
loud speaker on, or sat with the &#8217;phones clamped
to their ears, listening in and having much amusement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
with the various broadcasters, public and
private. It was a liberal education to hear a
tenth of what was going on, besides the regular
concert program each evening. But most in their
thoughts was the hope, often expressed between
them, of hearing something that might in some
way reflect on the kidnaping mystery, for the boys
missed their kind and courteous Italian friend.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>DIPLOMACY THAT FAILED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Gus, I can&#8217;t get it out of my head,&#8221; said Bill
one day, &#8220;that we&#8217;re not, as they say in diplomatic
language, entirely <i>persona grata</i> here. At
least, not as we should want to be if we have the
proper loyalty to the school. We have our
friends, of course, among seniors, freshmen and
even some of the sophs, but the sophs generally
have very little use for us. Even some of our
own class, in the sports, have a big leaning toward
Siebold and his bunch, and they like to go along
with the shouters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess they&#8217;ll have to go along, then,&#8221;
remarked Gus indifferently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Gus, it&#8217;s a reflection on us. We ought
to be in as good fellowship as anybody. Now
that we&#8217;ve made out so well in our radio work
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
and are not nearly so busy, with the rest of the
term all lectures and exams, you know, we might
gee in a little with the social end of it. And
sports, too, Gus. I can&#8217;t do anything but look
on and shout, but you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s remarks were inspired by a glimpse
across the greensward at a bunch of fellows on the
ball field, evidently at town ball and practice.
With the coming of spring and warm weather the
Tech ball team had been newly organized and
put at practice. The next month would see them
crossing bats with Guilford Academy, Springdale
School and other nearby institutions. There was
great rivalry between the home team and Guilford
Academy, which had a strong team, and was
much the better of the two, except that the Tech
School had acquired, through Siebold&#8217;s efforts, a
very good outside pitcher who kept the Academy
lads guessing much of the time. The winning of
games, therefore, during the preceding season had
been pretty even, Guilford leading by one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>And then, at the behest of older and more judicial
heads, representatives of the League of
Schools had met and decided that each team must
play only with members of its student body, hiring
no semi-professional pitchers, or even coachers,
thus making the contests entirely fair.
</p>
<p>A result of this was that in the games of this
season Guilford, with a pitcher from among its
fellows who had previously given his services to
other teams as well, simply ran away with Marshallton
Tech, winning one game by the score of
fifteen to two and the other was a shut-out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gus, I&#8217;ve bought a ball and I&#8217;ve got Sam
Kerry, who says he used to catch for his home
team somewhere in the west, to agree to keep his
mouth shut and pass a few with you, off somewhere
where nobody will see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto, old Bill! Anything you say&mdash;but
what&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Gus, I don&#8217;t like Guilford&#8217;s swamping
this team in the way it has, and I propose to try
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
to stop it.&#8221; Bill&#8217;s lips were compressed and he
had that look in his eyes that meant determination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Siebold&mdash;&#8221; began Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t entirely run this school, nor its ball
team, even if he is captain and general high
muck-a-muck,&#8221; declared Bill.
</p>
<p>It was with extreme satisfaction that Bill sat
on a log at one side of a path in the woods and
watched little Kerry, who proved to be no mean
hand at stopping all kinds of balls, nearly knocked
off his feet by the machine-gun-like pitches of
&#8220;that other fellow from Freeport,&#8221; as Gus was
sometimes called.
</p>
<p>One early afternoon the gym instructor also sat
by Bill and watched the performance. Mr. Gay
had promised secrecy, but not to refrain from
comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say he has not only got command of his
ball and three good styles, but he also knows some
tricks that ought to worry any man at the bat.
Throw that waiting ball again, Grier!&#8221; the instructor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
called. &#8220;I want to watch that&mdash;oh,
fine! It looks like a hard one and a fellow will
strike over it nine times out of ten. Well, I&#8217;ve
got this to say: If we expect to win any games
we&#8217;ve got to have a fellow like Grier in the box,
but Siebold will stick to Maxwell who is about a
fifth rater&mdash;at his best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But has Siebold all the say?&#8221; Bill queried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal of it. You see his father backs
up the boy in everything, and he has put the club
on its feet financially, in a bigger way than even
the Guilford team. Moreover, the elder Siebold&#8217;s
money built our grandstand, the dressing-rooms
and hired our pitchers for quite a while. So
young Siebold can afford to play politics and insure
a following, which nobody, even the professors,
can stop. And the faculty and the Doctor
don&#8217;t bother over the matter. That chap is going
to be a state senator, or a Congressman some
day, I have no doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t work, though, Mr. Gay,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Bill, &#8220;because it isn&#8217;t justice. Others besides Siebold
are interested in and loyal to the school.
We want to see our team win, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I&#8217;m going to shoot that at
Siebold and, if you&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;m going to hint
that we have a pitcher among us who outranks his
choice in all the high points.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was on the next afternoon, which was rainy,
that Bill found the library pretty full of readers
and among them were six or seven of the ball
team. He took a seat beside Dixon and directly
across the table from Siebold and Sadler. He
turned to Dixon:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When is the next ball game?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We play Springdale next Saturday, but
they&#8217;re easy. The last game with Guilford is
Saturday week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad that we get licked so unmercifully
when there&#8217;s no need for it,&#8221; Bill remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No need for it? No, there&#8217;s no need for it,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we have needed it to put some sense
into us, but no longer. It would be pretty easy
to clean that bunch if we went at it right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How easy?&#8221; asked Dixon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you know without asking that. Putting
a good man in the box and another behind the
bat, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get your good man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in the school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to keep your eyes open.
Anybody ought to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this, Siebold.&#8221; Dixon leaned over
the table. &#8220;Brown says we&#8217;ve got pitching material&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of it? Don&#8217;t I know it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blamed sure bet he doesn&#8217;t know it, or
if he does he ought to be jailed for conspiracy to
beat the school team,&#8221; laughed Bill, still addressing
Dixon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, Brown? What&#8217;s your dope?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
ventured Sadler, who alone really dared to question
Siebold&#8217;s authority. Bill went on, in forcible
language, for he was aware that Siebold was listening,
and repeated what he had said to Mr. Gay
and to Dixon. The argument about every one in
the school being interested in the success of the
ball team seemed to strike home, and several boys
gathering round began to make comments favorable
to the sentiment. The librarian came over
and objected to the talking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down to the gym and talk this thing
over,&#8221; said Sadler. &#8220;Brown will spring this
man on us if we&#8217;ll try him&mdash;eh, Brown?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; said Bill, rising.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Siebold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too busy reading. Nothing to it, anyway.&#8221;
Siebold didn&#8217;t even look up from his book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Sadler was angry. It was evident
that he was willing to oppose the captain.
Bill thought he saw an opportunity right here.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He has only one vote,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I understand
that all of us who care to may have a say.
I know several fellows who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill got no further. Siebold began to see that
it might be best to permit no defection from his
ranks and no outside interference. He followed
the others out and across the campus, no word
being said all the way by the several boys who, in
part, made up the executive committee on baseball.
They filed into the gym and got Mr. Gay
into their conference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, Brown, what have you got under
your skin?&#8221; said Siebold testily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard me in the library,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Balderdash! There isn&#8217;t a fellow in the
school who can pitch like Maxwell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there is, Siebold,&#8221; said Mr. Gay.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no one who can play first base like Maxwell
and your first baseman says he has a glass
arm and is done. We have a pitcher who can
pitch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the cheese!&#8221; said Maxwell. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told
Siebold all along he ought to replace me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this wonderful guy?&#8221; asked Siebold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s that other fellow from Freeport,&#8221;
put in one of the captain&#8217;s staunch supporters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it off in that case,&#8221; Siebold demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t call it off. We&#8217;ll try him at
practice,&#8221; said Sadler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s captain of this team? We&#8217;ll play in
our present positions, all of us, or we won&#8217;t play
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; echoed two or three followers.
Bill laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you accept a challenge to play a school
scrub team?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nor that. Waste of time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing but silly stubbornness,&#8221; said
Sadler, with rising wrath. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be just
like practice? You&#8217;re a fatheaded&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now, see here, Siebold,&#8221; interposed the instructor.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t refuse that. It will only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
bring out the best players and strengthen the
team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, if Mr. Gay says so,&#8221; Siebold
agreed, &#8220;we&#8217;ll play you and we can shut out any
bunch you can get together.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A SHUT-OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>Bill turned to Sadler. &#8220;You&#8217;re with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Siebold has a substitute for right field.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you, too,&#8221; said Dixon. &#8220;Put Longy
in my place, Cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Siebold grew angry. &#8220;You fellows have been
kickers all along, and now you think that will
weaken us. Well, if Ritter can&#8217;t take a fly better
than you can, you big stiff, I&#8217;ll assassinate him;
and Long is as good a short stop as you are,
Dixon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have four other substitutes and I&#8217;ll promise
three of them for our scrub team, Brown,&#8221;
Sadler declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; that&#8217;s seven fellows and we can
pick up two more, surely. Let&#8217;s hunt them up
right now,&#8221; demanded Bill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>They did. As it was clearing, they went to the
diamond and after a little practice all round at
town ball, Bill watching closely, they got into the
places best suited to each player and then elected
Bill manager and Sadler captain. The big fellow
and Dixon had discarded their suits for plain shirt
and trousers, and a small collection was taken up
for pants and some extra gloves. Mr. Gay gave
them a catcher&#8217;s mask and some bats.
</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the challenge having been
formally given, the match between the regulars
and scrubs took place, Siebold winning the toss
and taking the bases, Mr. Gay acted as umpire.
</p>
<p>Maxwell seemed to be in better form than usual.
Perhaps because he found a &#8220;ragged lot of players,&#8221;
as Bill put it. The scrubs had not fully got
together and they went out, two on strikes, and
Sadler&#8217;s fly was caught. The regulars went to
bat, laughing, Siebold straddling the plate.
</p>
<p>Gus stood in the box, smiling. He nodded to
little Kerry behind the bat and Kerry inclined his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
head to the left. Sadler and Dixon were watching
closely. Could the new pitcher on whom Brown
appeared to stake so much really do anything?
If he could send them over the way he boxed,
thought Sadler, &#8220;good night&#8221;! Brown was all
the time springing something worth while. That
was just why he and Dixon had been willing to
make a final kick at Siebold&#8217;s arbitrary rulings.
And now here was Siebold himself, one of the
surest batters in the team, facing the unknown
quantity.
</p>
<p>Gus put on no gimcracks nor did he make fancy
swings. He merely made a step forward, raised
his arm to throw and held it about two seconds&mdash;then
there came across the plate something
more like a streak than a ball&mdash;so it seemed to
Siebold&mdash;and little Kerry, who had been squatting,
nearly went over backward with the loud plop
in his glove. Siebold stood, dazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One strike!&#8221; called the umpire.
</p>
<p>The ball went back to Gus who took it out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the air as if he were plucking at a snowflake.
Again the step forward, the raised arm and the
ball came along swiftly at first, then slower, much
slower, but keeping up. Siebold&#8217;s heart sang.
He would take this thing on the end of his bat
and lift it beyond any hopes of a fielder&#8217;s reaching
it&mdash;it meant a two-bagger sure. He struck;
there was no contact of bat and ball; a fraction
of a second later the sound of the ball in Kerry&#8217;s
glove told him he had &#8220;missed it by a mile,&#8221; as
Sadler bawled it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two strikes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Siebold looked mad now. He was being tricked&mdash;that
was certain. He would show this fellow
if he could do that again! The ball came along
swiftly, but too high. It was &#8220;one ball,&#8221; and he
waited. The next was fairly swift, but it was
going to bounce before it struck, yet it lifted and
passed right over the plate almost a foot high and
Siebold wondered why he had not swiped at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Striker out!&#8221; called the umpire, and the captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
of the regulars angrily threw down his bat.
</p>
<p>Wilde came next. He was the regulars&#8217; catcher,
and the best batter of the team. Siebold stood,
watching closely, a scowl on his face. Almost the
same tactics were played, without Wilde ever
knowing where the ball was! Another chose three
bats before he got one to suit him&mdash;this fellow
was Kline, the bunter. More than once he had
made his base and let fellows on bases in by bunting
one at his own feet and in such a manner that
it rolled slowly toward the pitcher.
</p>
<p>Three balls were called against Gus. The regulars
commenced to smile and Siebold&#8217;s eyes
sparkled. Then three streaks came, all over the
plate, waist high and &#8220;striker out&#8221; sounded the
third time. The regulars went to the field, the
captain walking slowly and thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>Gus went to bat and struck out. Little Kerry
lifted a fly to left field that the fielder muffed and
let roll, so that Kerry slid into second when the
sphere was coming back again. Morton, a new
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
man, struck out as though he were not sure
whether he was fighting bears, or was merely in
a debate, and Dixon hit a grounder to second and
was caught out on first. Still no runs.
</p>
<p>Gus always had the short step forward, always
the uplifted arm that did not double forward at
once. It was possibly confusing, instead of a notice
to the batter to get ready, as one might have
imagined. Quite a number of balls were called
against Gus&mdash;fast, slow ones, up-shoots&mdash;but
never four. Three batters went out in quick succession.
</p>
<p>In the third inning Maxwell slowed up a little
and the scrubs became wider awake. One of the
new men who had, he declared, played ball very
little and never shown a genius for hitting, sent
a liner between pitcher and first that put him on
his base. One of the regulars&#8217; former substitutes
hit another grounder that let him on first and the
new man on second. The third and fourth man,
their second time at bat, struck out again and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
came big Sadler to the plate. His very first crack
sent a fly so high and wide that the center and left
fielders fell all over themselves in their effort to
get it, while the center man made a wild throw,
so that Sadler rather easily accomplished a home
run.
</p>
<p>It was three runs for the scrubs, as Gus again
struck out. The third at the bat for the regulars
proved to be &#8220;ancient history,&#8221; another expression
of Sadler&#8217;s, with this difference: Siebold took
his base on four balls, but he didn&#8217;t get any farther
than first.
</p>
<p>Little Kerry knocked another liner and this the
man on second dropped, the short-stop getting it
too late to first. Morton again went out. Dixon
hit a liner for two bases that let Kerry in and
again the new genius proved himself such by
getting in a fly that on errors put him on third.
Once more a substitute who after two fouls
knocked a ball almost within reach over the first
baseman&#8217;s head, made another home run on errors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
The fourth was caught out on a foul, the
fifth struck out and Sadler knocked another fly
that was caught. Six runs for the scrubs&mdash;the
regulars nothing.
</p>
<p>Smiling, Gus came again to the box. Three
batters in quick succession, after only three balls
were called for two of them, struck out. They
seemed to have no idea where the balls were passing,
and little Kerry staggered back with every
one sent in, though he, too, was smiling. And
then, before the regulars could again take their
places, something else occurred.
</p>
<p>Siebold merely said: &#8220;Hold on, fellows!&#8221; He
walked straight up to Gus, caught him by the arm
and pulled him over toward Bill and Mr. Gay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Siebold; &#8220;I&#8217;m no piker. I&#8217;ve
been dead wrong and nobody has to tell me. So,
Grier, honestly I never saw such pitching outside
of the national leagues. And if you&#8217;ll let me, I
want to be friends, and I want you on the team.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Mr. Gay, you&#8217;re right: Maxwell on first and you,
Grier, in the box. Are you with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Siebold extended his hand and Gus shook it
warmly. The captain turned to Bill. &#8220;You, too.
We have to thank you for this business, the best
stroke of luck we have ever had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill shook Siebold&#8217;s hand with as much gusto
as he would have that of any downright hero. A
fellow who could muzzle his pride and do the
square thing in this manner, especially after he
had been licked in a way that hurt, was a real
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And look here, Brown! I&#8217;ve generally messed
up this captain business and the managing too;
and you have got together a team in short order
that I wouldn&#8217;t have believed could have slammed
us for six runs. Will you manage us? I&#8217;ll see
that you are elected. Grier can be cap&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;Gus doesn&#8217;t want to be
captain. You&#8217;ll remain captain, Siebold, or we&#8217;ll
both take our doll clothes and go home. But I will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
try my hand at advising, if you wish. &#8216;Two
heads,&#8217; you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Siebold. &#8220;Brown is manager!
And we&#8217;ve got a pitcher now! We&#8217;re
going to lick those Guilford fellows so bad they&#8217;ll
think they&#8217;ve got brain fever!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MARSHALLTON <i>versus</i> GUILFORD</h3>
</div>

<p>Bill for once laid aside everything but his
studies to give his attention to the game with
Guilford Academy, the last athletic contest of the
school year. It was played at Guilford, where
the grounds were fenced in and tickets of invitation
given. As manager of the visiting team, Bill
had his quota to distribute in and outside of the
Tech. With his characteristic thoroughness he
saw that no one was slighted who was at all
worthy, rich or poor. This was not so liberally
managed at the Guilford end.
</p>
<p>The grand stand was pretty well filled, but Bill
had reserved some good seats and to these he
conducted the Farrells and their niece, stopping
to tell them that Gus was pitching and that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
must root for Marshallton, which of course they
did. After this, with some tickets left over, Bill
went outside and skirted the grounds, finding a
dozen youngsters hunting holes in the fence, and
to these he gave his remaining tickets. Not so
long ago, he had been just such a youngster himself,
and he had an abounding sympathy for those
who possessed the keenest capacity for enjoyment,
but were excluded without just reason.
</p>
<p>The game was typical of such contests between
schools of the kind in all except the performance
of Gus in the box. That youth, always smiling,
never self-conscious enough even to acknowledge
the plaudits meant for him, not only pitched with
professional skill, but in his every movement
showed a grace which demanded attention.
</p>
<p>From the first inning the result was a foregone
conclusion. The home team held the visitors to
no runs and went to bat with the utmost confidence,
only to be retired, one, two, three, on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
strikes. They shut the visitors out again, and two
of them got on bases to remain there and die.
They let Siebold come home on Wilde&#8217;s fly and
errors and were again fanned.
</p>
<p>They repeated this, with little Kerry at bat and
only one of them made a hit, the ball lodging in
the pitcher&#8217;s extended hand. They fought hard
and retired the Techs for three more innings,
meeting the same fate themselves. Then their
pitcher weakened and the team went to pieces,
with three men on bases, and Wilde let them all
come home on a long grounder, but himself died
on second, with two others out on strikes.
</p>
<p>They went to pieces again when Sadler knocked
a fly over the fence and made a home run, or
rather a home walk, and they again were retired
in rapid succession. Score, six to nothing, and the
Marshallton crowd, including the dignified president
of Tech, the instructors to a man, the Farrells
and a lot of other sympathizers yelled their
throats sore, a bunch of fans going for Gus, hoisting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
him on high and marching around with him,
singing a school chantey:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;He&#8217;s the stuff,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He treats &#8217;em rough,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He gives &#8217;em easily more than enough.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He&#8217;s awful tough</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He is no bluff,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He made &#8217;em look like a powder puff.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He&#8217;s fast and quick,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>They couldn&#8217;t handle ball or stick.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>He&#8217;s winning Dick,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>They got his kick,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>They think they&#8217;re slaughtered with a brick!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And so on for half a dozen or so silly verses of
the kind, Gus, meanwhile, suffering both physically
and mentally, for being thus tossed about is by
no means comfortable, and his modesty was such
as to make him want to run and hide.
</p>
<p>And then the gang went for Bill, but Doctor
Field protected him and they expended their
enthusiasm on Captain Siebold, Sadler and little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Kerry, the catcher. After which Guilford asked
for a return match, but the term was nearly ended
and that must go over until next year.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Bill to Doctor Field, as they
journeyed homeward, &#8220;that Tony Sabaste could
have been here to see this game.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A CLUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Exams and exercises were over and the students
mostly gone. A few remained to brush up on
studies, or to complete work begun in the shop.
Bill and Gus were among these. They had an
order from one of the professors for a very fine
radio receiver and it was not quite finished. The
matron and cooks had vanished and the boys had
to get their own meals. As one after another of
the lingerers left, the dormitory became quieter,
almost oppressively lonesome, to Bill at least, who
was social by nature; but Gus, the hermit, rather
enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>Listening in over the radio was not neglected.
It served to cheer the monotony. Not only were
the boys alive to the advertised concerts and entertainments,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
but they caught a tangle of outside
waves that was often quite amusing.
</p>
<p>Only two more days were required for them to
finish their job. They had decided to let their
receiver remain, as they were to occupy the same
room next term, and now two receivers at home
would serve. The loud speaker had been removed,
adjustments made, and now Bill sat at the little
table with the &#8217;phones clamped on his ears.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he called to Gus: &#8220;Get &#8217;em on! Get
em&#8217; on, quick! Somebody is sending a message
out to Marconi&mdash;only the end of it now, though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;be most honored, I assure you,&#8221; came
through the air. &#8220;Several whom I think you will
be glad to meet will be there and we shall be glad
to have a word from you.&#8221; There was a pause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an invitation to a banquet, or something,&#8221;
Gus said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I wonder if he&#8217;s going to accept.&#8221; This
from Bill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When did he come back? I thought he sailed
away last fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been back a week; read it in the paper. He&#8217;s
on his boat again, the <i>El</i>&mdash;listen! He&#8217;s talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marconi speaking. Gentlemen of the Society
of Electrical Research, I shall accept with much
pleasure, but please do not put me down for an
extended speech. Only a few remarks&mdash;probably
on my subject. But I shall make no reference to
Mars; my interest in that is almost nil. That is a
newspaper romance, and I am really getting very
tired of being misunderstood. I would be very
glad if, in the course of the evening, someone
would jestingly refer to this and absolve me from
holding such untenable ideas. I thank you. I
shall be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee-whiz, Gus, I wonder if the time will ever
come when we&#8217;ll get invitations like that, eh? And
say, he doesn&#8217;t take any stock in that message-from-Mars
foolishness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s silly, all right,&#8221; Gus agreed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure. They can&#8217;t even tell if Mars has
any life on it, and if it has, it is mighty unlikely
that any kind of creatures have developed brains
enough to understand radio. Shucks! No real
scientist will waste his time on any guesswork
like that. We want to know more through the
telescope first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe the telescope can&#8217;t tell us&mdash;then
what? We want to get at it anyway we can, don&#8217;t
we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose, in any sensible, possible, likely
way, but not on such a supposition. It would be
like shooting at the moon: <i>if</i> a high-powered gun
could get its projectile beyond our attraction of
gravitation and <i>if</i> it were aimed right, why, then
the shot might hit the mark. Too blamed many
&#8216;ifs.&#8217; And some of the greatest astronomers say
Mars isn&#8217;t inhab&mdash;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A very distant, not easily understood voice
came to them. There seemed to be some interference
which not even their well-made loose coupler
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
could filter out. Apparently there could be nothing
very entertaining about this, except the desire
to get the better of a difficult task.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash; Atlantic. Latitude 39 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; chased her,
but &mdash; lost &mdash;. The fog was &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;. On board,
when start &mdash; &mdash; transferred, we think. Headed
west. Got a radio from the Government tug Nev
&mdash; &mdash;. Think it must have been the same. Putting
in toward Point Gifford, they said &mdash;. Think they
have landed by now. Better opportunity to demand
ransom from the &mdash;. Italian all right; sure
of that. &mdash; The banker will &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;. So you
be &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice died away; a few clickings came and
then silence. Bill turned to Gus. In matters of
jumping at conclusions, he had long learned to
depend most on his chum&#8217;s undoubted talents,
just as Gus, in most things mental, played second
fiddle to Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Gus, could it be&mdash;?&#8221; Bill whispered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure is! Nothing else. Ransom, banker,
Italian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus felt no uncertainty. &#8220;They&#8217;re after them,
sure. Mr. Sabaste has had the hunt kept up on
land and sea&mdash;we know that. And this is just a
clue&mdash;an attempt to get on the trail again. Point
Gifford&mdash;Bill, I know that country. Went all
along the coast there once with Uncle Bob. You
remember when? He was cutting timber down in
the coast swamps. I explored&mdash;great place for
that! Sand dunes, pines, inlets; awfully wild.
Some old cabins here and there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re landing there. Gus, I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;re
going to bring&mdash;do you think it can be Tony,
Gus?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else? They&#8217;re trying to make Mr. Sabaste
pay a ransom and they&#8217;re going to be in a
place where they can make sure of getting it.
What Tony said about the Malatesta bunch being
short of money must be true, and I guess that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
restaurant business made it worse. They&#8217;re going
to try to make a pretty sure thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Gus, this radio was intended for somebody
on shore who will watch them and maybe
nab them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. They&#8217;re not likely to nab them.
They have already landed, you see, and the detectives
will watch the Upper Point, which is the only
landing place. But if these chaps are foxy, they
will come to the Lower Point, ten miles south, and
cut across the inlet and the thoroughfare in a small
boat. Then their yacht, or whatever she is, will sail
up past the Upper Point, put to sea and the detectives
will think she has given up the idea of landing.
I rather think I&#8217;m on to what their scheme will be.
An old oysterman showed me what some smugglers
did, and got away with it for a long time.
I guess the state police never have got on to this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Gus, it&#8217;s up to us to tell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With several thousand dollars to save for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Tony&#8217;s dad? And who would believe a couple of
kids, anyway?&#8221; demanded Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them watch the Upper Point, and if they
land there, all right. I&#8217;m going down to hunt over
the Lower Point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Gus? But these fellows are a bunch of
desperate scamps; gunmen, no doubt. There&#8217;ll
be a lot of them, maybe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not more than two or three. Luigi Malatesta,
his brother, I think from Merritt&#8217;s description,
and an accomplice or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four, Gus; maybe more. You wouldn&#8217;t have
a chance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not in a stand-up fight, I suppose. But
they won&#8217;t be suspecting a kid in old fisherman&#8217;s
duds, and I can do some bushwhacking, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you get hurt, Gus?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a lot more like me everywhere.
Another brother at home, too. I&#8217;m going to try
for it, Bill. I&#8217;m not going to tote a pistol, but take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Dad&#8217;s hammerless, double-barreled shotgun. He
has quit hunting, and he said I could have it.
They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m just a native.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are you going to hang out? Your
Uncle Bob isn&#8217;t there any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With old Dan, the oysterman. He&#8217;ll be tickled,
I think, and I&#8217;ll pay my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get hurt, old fellow. I wish I could go
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I wish you could, Bill. But you pick
up what you can and maybe you&#8217;ll have a chance
to get it to me in some way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Gus, I know a scheme: That portable set
we made Tompkins&mdash;it&#8217;s in his room. He would
be tickled, for he liked Tony, and he has gone to
Saranac Lake. They&#8217;ve got one up there, so he
didn&#8217;t take this. We&#8217;ll get in his room and get it
for you to take along. Then I&#8217;ll stay here, glue
my ear to the phones and radio you everything I
know, for they are all away, and I can use their
transmitter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Portable idea is fine, Bill, but all the rest is
bunk. What, really, can you do here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I know: We&#8217;ll swipe the keys,
unhook the school transmitting set and I&#8217;ll go with
you and set it up at Oysterman Dan&#8217;s. Then we
can work together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! But how about the license?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got one. Merely change of locality, and my
own license will let me operate anywhere. Let&#8217;s
get busy.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AT OYSTERMAN DAN&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a good cause, yet the boys were up
against a doubtful procedure. The janitor of the
school was a good-natured, but stubborn chap.
He liked Bill and Gus, but they knew he would
never let them take anything from the buildings
without special consent. And while there was no
time to get this permission, Bill and Gus knew
that all concerned would be in favor of their
motive. If they injured anything they knew they
would more than make it good; or that Mr. Sabaste
would make it good. Even Mr. Hooper would, if
called on.
</p>
<p>So they wrote a note to Mr. Hooper, explaining
fully what they intended doing and requesting
that he reimburse the school for any loss or injury
to the broadcasting instrument in case anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
happened to both of them. Then they placed this
letter where it would be found in their room, with
a request to the finder to deliver it.
</p>
<p>The janitor, they knew, was a bug on fishing.
Bill coaxed him to take a day off while they
watched the place. He did this, and while Mrs.
Royce was strenuously engaged with her housework,
the boys got the keys to the radio room.
The rest was easy, even to fixing up camouflaged
parts that would befool Mr. Royce, if he should
enter the room. They got the apparatus in parts
to their own room, where they packed it up, and
Gus climbed into Tompkins&#8217; room through the
transom, handed out the portable set and got out
the way he got in.
</p>
<p>The next day, again sending for Mr. Merritt
and his taxi, they were on their way to the station
at Guilford, and from there by train to the shore,
Gus debouching at a convenient junction for a two-hour
trip home, while Bill patiently waited. When
Gus got back to the junction he had the shotgun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
and some old clothes for both, though Bill might
have no need to disguise.
</p>
<p>Reaching the terminus of the railroad, the boys
hired a rather dilapidated team of mules drawing
a farm wagon, with youthful driver to match, and
made a long, slow journey, especially tiresome to
these eager, expectant lads, that landed them by
the most direct route at Oysterman Dan&#8217;s little
cottage.
</p>
<p>The old fellow came out and was so delighted
to see Gus that he gave him and Bill a real welcome.
He was a bachelor who lived alone, but
lived well. He kept to himself and yet was not
averse to having a little company of his own
choosing. Apparently he would not have wanted
more entertaining fellows than Bill and Gus, or
better listeners, for he liked to spin yarns. When
he found the boys insisted upon paying him for
board and lodging and certain privileges he was
further pleased. Let them put up &#8220;one o&#8217; them
thar wirelesses?&#8221; He sure would and welcome.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
It would be a &#8220;heap o&#8217; fun,&#8221; and when they told
him of the purpose of it he was elated.
</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more characteristic of
the imagination and optimism of youth than the
making of all these extensive preparations on the
merest guesswork, and after the boys had arrived
on the scene, not half a mile from Lower Gifford&#8217;s
Point, doubts began to assail Bill with much force.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By jingo, Gus! Here we are, at considerable
expense and a deal of trouble, taking it for granted
that we&#8217;re going to do wonderful things, and we
even don&#8217;t know that the theory we are working
on is worth a blamed thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; we do,&#8221; said the intuitive Gus, who,
looking like a woebegone swamp dweller, had just
come in from the dunes. &#8220;And soon we&#8217;ll know a
whole lot more. I just saw two gunners in the
woods above the point, and if they aren&#8217;t Italians
I don&#8217;t know one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were a long day putting up their transmitting
instrument, with its extensive aërial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
stretched between tall pines near the cottage. They
would depend on the portable receiver.
</p>
<p>And then, leaving Bill listening, poring over
books, or chatting with old Dan, when the latter
was off the water, Gus got into his ragged togs
again, took his gun and started out prowling. And
he prowled wisely and well.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>GUS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hey, fellow! What you do?&#8221; The voice came
from among the pines, and Gus turned to see a
dark-skinned, black-eyed young man, of about
twenty-five or more, coming toward him. Gus
stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shoot in these woods?&#8221; asked the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I might an&#8217; I reckon I do if I kin find
any durn thing fer t&#8217; shoot,&#8221; said Gus, easily
falling into the native vernacular.
</p>
<p>The man approached and the boy quickly observed
that the pocket of the loose coat, worn even
this hot day, bulged perceptibly, and the man put
his hand within it. He showed an interest in the
shotgun and extended his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you get so fine gun, eh?&#8221; he questioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man give her t&#8217; me fer beatin&#8217; him at shootin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
This was literally true, the said man being
Mr. Grier. &#8220;He&#8217;s a sportin&#8217; feller, but he don&#8217;t
shoot no more. Hain&#8217;t seen him round these here
parts fer two year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fellow took the fowling-piece and looked it
over. He said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I buy her, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t buy her if you had her heft in
gold,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;An&#8217; you couldn&#8217;t shoot her,
anyway&mdash;not to hit anything. Could you get a
bird with her goin&#8217; like a bullet through these pine
trees? Shucks! I kin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Yes? I get you shoot for me, eh?&#8221; handing
back the gun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot fer you? How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like law policemans, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t like &#8217;em if they chased you fer
shootin&#8217; when the game laws was on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of that. You come into woods along of
me, now, eh? I show you what do and how make
large lot money. Big! And maybe how shoot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
policemans to keep away. Big money you get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead me to it!&#8221; said Gus, his swift guess at
what might be coming making him shove in a less
backwoodsy phrase.
</p>
<p>Without another word the man started along a
tortuous and narrow path and Gus followed for
more than half a mile. They were just off the
thoroughfare when they started, but the youth
could hear the distant booming of the ocean waves
on the beach before they stopped.
</p>
<p>To the right, with a roof seen above the low
underbrush of young pines, holly and sweet gum,
was a building of some kind toward which the
path turned abruptly. A hundred yards ahead
the woods ceased, and Gus knew that beyond were
the ever-shifting sand dunes crowned with their
short-lived scrub oaks or pines and tufts of beach
grass which bordered a wild and lonely shore for
many miles. Twelve miles to the south was a
somewhat popular seaside resort.
</p>
<p>Gus had not crossed the woods at this spot,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
though he had at some other very similar places.
He had been all along the beach and had boated on
the thoroughfare clear to the inlet. This was
nowhere deep enough for even a large sloop. But
he was thinking less of this than of a very possible
opportunity that seemed to loom ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What your name?&#8221; asked the Italian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam is my name,&#8221; said Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Sam, you stay here. If some man
who no business has here come to look, you give
order to go&mdash;see? You say this your father&#8217;s
ground and no&mdash;what you call?&mdash;trespass. All
this day you stay. To-morrow you come, also.
Two dollar you get each day, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought it was <i>big</i> money. Mebbe I&#8217;ll have t&#8217;
shoot somebody an&#8217; I will, quick. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We give three dollar, Sam, and you stay with
us. If not and somebody comes you get nothing
but this.&#8221; The man slapped his pocket. &#8220;But no,
we friends, eh? And you will shoot?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I will!&#8221; said Gus, and meant it. But
whom would he shoot? He was not saying.
</p>
<p>The man went toward the building and presently
came back with a modern, high-powered rifle.
He edged off through the woods to the left. After
a while he came back with another fellow and they
fell to talking in a language which Gus could not
understand. They stopped for the new man to
look Gus over and the boy turned his head to gaze
at none other than his late schoolmate and bitter
antagonist, Luigi Malatesta!
</p>
<p>The general resemblance between the two men
made Gus know that he had been talking to the
older brother. Luigi, the younger, went off. At
that distance he could not have recognized Gus,
though for one moment the boy had a queer feeling,
a real bit of fright, but not enough to rob
him of the quick sense to be ready with his gun
if his enemy had guessed his identity. On second
thought Gus felt pretty sure that if he kept his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
ragged hat well pulled down Luigi would never
know him.
</p>
<p>And Gus was tremendously elated, so much so
that he could hardly keep from prancing or slapping
himself; but the danger of what he meant to
do, and to do quickly, kept him from undue exuberance.
</p>
<p>The elder Malatesta brought one other fellow,
evidently an American, to take a squint at Gus.
Gus called the Italian over:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of you got here, hey? I don&#8217;t want
t&#8217; shoot one of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not any more; three of us; you four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is all this fuss fer?&#8221; asked Gus.
</p>
<p>The fellow seemed to ponder a moment. &#8220;I
tell you,&#8221; he said, as though with sudden conviction.
&#8220;In the hut yonder is crazy man. Our
brother, yes. We love heem, ver&#8217; much. But he
malsano&mdash;insane&mdash;lika fury. And we disgrazia.
But he not go to a silo&mdash;hospital and treat bad.
Oh, no! We swear it! They want getta heem.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
We hid heem and give heem treatment&mdash;medicine,
lika say great doctore. Doctore come two day&mdash;more
tardo. We guard brother ver&#8217; fierce&mdash;fight&mdash;fight!
No let go&mdash;no let policeaman come. See?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus nodded slowly. It was a well-told yarn, a
plausible lie. In a good cause could he not take a
turn at that?
</p>
<p>&#8220;By cracky, you&#8217;re dead right t&#8217; make &#8217;em mind
their own bizness! It&#8217;s your bizness, ain&#8217;t it? I&#8217;d
serve &#8217;em that-away, too. I&#8217;ll bluff &#8217;em, an&#8217; shoot,
too, if I got t&#8217;. Where&#8217;s these other two standin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man indicated a spot to the left, another
beyond the cabin, and his own position toward the
beach. They probably stood on sentry duty most
of the time. Gus was given the most dangerous
place, the one most likely to be the way of approach.
Well, he&#8217;d better act, and quickly, if he
didn&#8217;t want the officers of the law to step in ahead
and spoil his own plans.
</p>
<p>Gus waited until he felt sure the men had taken
their places again. Then he contrived a neat bit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of strategy that was almost too simple. He meant
to get a peep in yonder building, or hut, as the
elder Malatesta had called it, and he meant to do
this at once. Rapidly and silently he sneaked
through the woods until he stood close behind the
American gunman who sat drowsily on a log, his
gun across his knees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, bo, get next. They&#8217;s a couple o&#8217; men
sneakin&#8217; through the woods round beyon&#8217; you.
They ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; my way. Lay low an&#8217; watch
&#8217;em.&#8221; The man crouched.
</p>
<p>Gus crept back and then out toward the beach
where, by sheer good luck, he came across both
Malatesta brothers talking. When they were still
at a little distance from him he told them the same
story and instantly the elder was on his guard
while the younger brother left, crouching as he
progressed toward his station. Gus, also crouching,
went back quickly.
</p>
<p>The boy felt sure that these fellows were armed
and that they would remain fixed for a very considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
time&mdash;all of them well out of sight of
the building. Cautiously at first, then almost
running, Gus followed the path right up to the
door of what was really a stout log cabin, the one
window barred with heavy oaken slats, recently
nailed on, and the door padlocked. Gus went
straight to the window, thrust aside a bit of bagging
that served for a curtain and peered within.
Speaking hardly above a whisper, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, in here! Who are you? Is it Tony
Sabaste?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE PRISONER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want? Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus felt his heart almost leap in his bosom.
The voice may have been a little huskier, with an
accent of suffering and despair, but it was recognizable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep very quiet, Tony. I&#8217;m not supposed to
be here, but out yonder, guarding the path. Paid
to do it, you understand? But lie low until to-morrow.
Then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me; I seem&mdash;I&mdash;who can you be? Oh,
what&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know me, sure enough. I&#8217;m
Gus, Tony&mdash;Gus Grier. Bill Brown and I are
down here to get you. We&mdash;, but that must keep.
Lie low, old chap. I&#8217;ve got to get away now and
go awfully careful, but it&#8217;ll be all right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Gus! My friend Gus! You here and for
me? I believed the world&mdash;but no matter now.
Oh, my good friend Gus, you will not never give
up? You will&mdash;oh, my friend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go slow, Tony, not so loud! Do you think we
would come this far and then go back on you? I
must get away now&mdash;right off. Lie low.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus felt an almost irresistible desire to break
open the window or the door at once and get his
friend out. Then, if need be, fight their way to
safety, but common sense told him that the certain
noise of doing such a thing would be heard
and perhaps his effort defeated, with great danger
to himself, and Tony, too. If there had been
but one guard or even two&mdash;but three were too
great odds.
</p>
<p>Back he went to his position, and there he
watched for the rest of the day, elated with his
discovery of Tony, saddened by the delay, grinning
at the thought of the Malatesta and their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
confederate compelled to watch, almost motionless,
for the supposed prowlers.
</p>
<p>At last darkness threatened. Those small banditti,
the mosquitoes, as bloody-minded as the
Malatesta, began to sing and to stab. The assassin
owls made mournful cadences in keeping
with the scene and its half-tragic human purposes,
while the whippoorwills voiced the one element of
brightness and hope.
</p>
<p>The young fellow in the narrow, dark, log-walled
cabin, with its barred window and padlocked
oaken door, had been long disconsolate.
But now, for the first time in many days, hope
came to him as he walked back and forth, fighting
pests, still tortured in mind, fearing failure, wondering,
praying, yet proud and never beseeching,
waiting for another and perhaps a brighter day.
</p>
<p>For three months he had been a prisoner, waking
from a fevered sleep after a long illness, his
splendid constitution alone serving to doctor him,
he had found himself mysteriously at sea, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
locked cabin of a tossing yacht that knew no harbor
of rest. He had been denied even the chance
to talk to, or to know his jailers. He had managed
to keep alive on the rough, often unpalatable
food poked under his door. There was no response
to his callings, hammerings or threats. A
less balanced, hopeful, kindly, gentle fellow would
have gone insane.
</p>
<p>Then, gagged and bound, he had been dumped
about almost like a sack of wheat and landed in
this horrible place alongside of which his prison
room in the yacht was a palace. Now here for
the first time had come a friendly voice, that of
more than a friend, indeed, and he had again
seized upon hope.
</p>
<p>Yes, he would lie low, be patient, hope on and
wait.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>STRATEGY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Bill, Bill, we&#8217;ve found Tony! Saw him a little
in the dark and talked to him. We&#8217;re going to get
him out, Bill!&#8221; And Gus, after bursting in with
this good news, told his chum and old Dan all
about it. Then they held a council of war.
</p>
<p>It was pretty certain that the Malatesta had
no means of radio communication, as they could
not have burdened themselves with the apparatus,
nor could they have confined their communications
to one person. That they were seeking ransom
money was also pretty certain, and they were in
a position to get it, too.
</p>
<p>Bill, Gus and old Dan laid some plans, carefully
considered from every angle, and with the impetus
of youth to be acted upon at once. Having
put their transmitting station in operation, Bill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
got busy on the wires, and on a wave length of 360
meters, began broadcasting notifications to Mr.
Sabaste and to the police relative to Tony&#8217;s whereabouts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Angelo Sabaste, do not send ransom
money. Mr. Angelo Sabaste, do not send ransom
money. Please convey this message to Mr. Angelo
Sabaste, banker, of New York City, do not
send ransom money. Police departments and
coast patrol, send swift vessels all along the coast
to Lower Point Gifford, and the lower inlet to
head off any foray from the sea on the part of
those who may have caught this; also to prevent
escape of kidnapers from the inlet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send men to surround the point and cut off
escape by land along the peninsula north of the
inlet; also to watch the lower thoroughfare.
Some men meet the senders of this at Oysterman
Dan&#8217;s, in neck of woods above Lower Point
Gifford, to raid kidnapers&#8217; roost from there, and
effect rescue of young Anthony Sabaste.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Station men and vessels to-night. Watch all
landing places around Lower Point. Be prepared
for trouble. Kidnapers armed and will shoot.
Anthony Sabaste in small cabin in pine woods
about one mile north of inlet. Hard place to find.
Guarded by three men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is William Brown speaking, at Oysterman
Dan&#8217;s cottage&mdash;for Augustus Grier, also.
Have situation well in hand. Please radio reply
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill switched off his batteries and clamped the
&#8217;phones of the receiver to his ears. He had to
listen in for but a few moments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Police Department, City. West Rural Section
speaking. We are in direct communication
with East State Mounted Force and contingents
and will relay, acting in unison. Also in communication
with coast patrol who also have your
radio, no doubt, and will act independently. We
are sending men and will make raid in morning,
closing in north of Lower Point. Men sent to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Oysterman Dan&#8217;s house to-night. Coast patrol
will also go out to-night. Will advise you personally
in the morning. Have Dan send boat for men
across thoroughfare to Stone Landing. If men
not there by three A.M., go to Possum Beach and
wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill still listened and the message was repeated,
almost verbatim; then silence. He communicated
the information to Gus and old Dan, and the
oysterman went off to tidy up his boat for the
trip. Bill and Gus decided to snatch a little
sleep. Old Dan, who had napped in the afternoon
as usual, agreed to wake them before he left at
about two o&#8217;clock, which he did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill, I&#8217;ve got a hunch we are going at this
thing a little too fast,&#8221; said Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How too fast? We can&#8217;t delay at all, can
we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose, when the police make their raid,
these Malatestas get desperate and mad enough
to kill Tony? They&#8217;re a bad lot. I&#8217;ve a notion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
we ought to get Tony out of there before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The iron gets too hot, eh? I guess you are
right, Gus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Bill, here&#8217;s a scheme. What if we work
it this way?&#8221; Gus proceeded to outline a plan
with every detail of which Bill agreed; and it
called for action.
</p>
<p>Taking the revolver and some extra cartridges,
Bill hobbled along by Gus, who gave him a lift,
now and then, piggy-back. The boys made their
way south for more than a mile along the thoroughfare
swamp edge. Then they turned sharply
on a path across the wooded peninsula to the
beach, and went another half mile among the dunes.
A very tall pine tree against the sky-line gave Gus
his bearings. A little below that they stopped,
and Bill found a comfortable hiding-place among
scrub pines, with the boom of the breakers in his
ears and the sea breeze keeping off the mosquitoes.
</p>
<p>Gus cast about silently for the path that led in
to the kidnapers&#8217; cabin. Finding it with some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
difficulty in the darkness, he noted certain landmarks
and went back to Bill. Agreeing on signals
in whispers, Gus went back to the path and
struck a match, whereupon Bill fired a shot, and
immediately afterward, another. Then Gus
swiftly made his way directly toward the cabin,
and when near it, called softly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, hello, you fellers! It&#8217;s me, Sam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a very profound silence for a few
minutes. Gus called again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! It&#8217;s me, Sam. Don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And very much with his heart in his mouth, but
still determined, he advanced, crouching low so
that a bullet would most likely pass high over him.
Suddenly a figure appeared directly in front of
him and a flashlight was thrown in his face for
an instant. Gus knew that he had been identified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay low,&#8221; he whispered, not forgetting to keep
up the dialect. &#8220;They&#8217;re out there, somebody&mdash;sneakin&#8217;
along in the open. I seen &#8217;em an&#8217; let fly
at &#8217;em an&#8217; they shot back, but I run on down the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
woodses. Git yer gang an&#8217; come along so&#8217;s we
kin head &#8217;em off if they start in here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How we do that? We stay here an&#8217; fight &#8217;em,
eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that&#8217;ll give &#8217;em the lay o&#8217; this place. We
want t&#8217; draw &#8217;em up the beach. Chase along up
through the woodses an&#8217; come out &#8217;bout a mile
above and shoot oncet er twicet. Two of us kin
do that an&#8217; two kin lay out yan at the end o&#8217; the
path an&#8217; watch fer any of &#8217;em startin&#8217; in this
away, an&#8217; then you kin lead &#8217;em off. See?
That&#8217;s the way the smugglin&#8217; fellers do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plan must have looked good to the fellow
still in the darkness; Gus did not know to whom
he was talking, but he heard the man walk away
rapidly. He waited, as though on pins, and in
a moment three figures loomed before him, one
voice questioning him again. The boy tactfully
repeated his suggestions&mdash;then turned back with
them as they started forward, evidently agreeing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>One fellow, Gus could see, was rubbing his eyes.
All carried guns.
</p>
<p>Two men kept to the path that led toward the
beach edge of the woods. Another and Gus went
straight on. Presently Gus suggested that they
stop and rest awhile; then move on farther up,
stop, scatter a little, and listen. He would sneak
out into the open, he said, and look around.
There was no danger of his being seen. It would
be best to remain thus for an hour or more&mdash;perhaps
till morning, mosquitoes or no mosquitoes.
A grunt signified agreement.
</p>
<p>The boy crept out toward the dunes and on,
until he felt sure he could not be heard. Then,
with the smooth, hard sand for a track he ran,
softly on tiptoe, until once again he came below
the tall pine. A low hiss thrice repeated was answered,
and he found Bill in the same spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all stuck along in the woods yonder,&#8221;
Gus whispered. &#8220;If you hear them moving off
toward the cabin again, shoot. If they go on,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
shoot twice. If they come your way, lie low.
Here goes for Tony, old scout!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus had some difficulty getting to the cabin
from the south side. He missed it once, got too
far into the woods, turned, regained the dunes,
struck in again and this time started to pass
within a few yards of it, but by merest chance saw
the gable end against the sky.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='XXVI_A_CALL_FOR_HELP' id='XXVI_A_CALL_FOR_HELP'></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>A CALL FOR HELP</h3>
</div>

<p>Again Gus approached the cabin, feeling sure
now of the outcome of the plan. He reached the
clump of thick pines below the tall one and turned
to make the bee-line in, not a hundred yards from
the building, when the alarm notes of a ruffed
grouse reached his ears. It was just ahead, the
angry, quick, threatening call of a mother bird,
disturbed with her young, quick to fight and to
warn them of danger. Might not this be a weasel,
fox or mink that had sneaked upon her? But if
so, it would be the note of warning only, to scatter
the little ones into hiding-places while the hen
sought a safe shelter just out of the reach of the
marauder and after she had, pretending a hurt,
led it to a distance from the brood.
</p>
<p>But this was different. The grouse had played
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
her usual trick of decoy, no doubt, and failing in
this had returned to attack something regarded
as a larger enemy. She would know better than
to include deer, or the wandering, half-wild cattle
of the peninsula as such. There were no puma
and few bear in these woods, and surely none
here. What then could the disturber be but a
man? Gus well knew the ways of these knowing
birds.
</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s advance now became so cautious as
to make no audible sound even to himself, such
being possible over the pine needles. Slowly he
gained a vantage point where again the roof gable
was visible against the sky. No sound ahead, except
the mother grouse making the sweetest music
imaginable in calling her young ones together during
a half minute. The coast must be clear,&mdash;but
just as the boy was about to go boldly forward,
a flash of light shone about him and his staring
eyes discerned, not thirty feet away, the three
watchers standing together. They had returned,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
probably by pre-arrangement and had met in the
roadway. Now they were silently listening for
the fourth fellow&mdash;himself. One chap, thinking
that they were not observed, had struck a match
to see the time, or to light a cigarette. Had they
been looking in Gus&#8217;s direction they might have
seen him. Presently, mumbling some words, they
all went on again toward the cabin, and Gus, sick
at heart because seeing now no chance for a renewal
of his effort, turned back after an hour to
where Bill waited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Gus, they came out here, all of them
together and went part way over to the beach,
then returned almost right away. I could hear
only their voices at first, but when they came back
they passed close enough for me to hear a little
of what they said, I think it was the Malatesta
that we know. He was declaring that &#8216;he,&#8217; and
I guess he meant you, must be the same. Do you
think he knows you, Gus?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They must be suspicious of my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
story, or my purpose, anyway, or they would have
stayed out and watched. Perhaps one of them
followed far enough to hear me head out this way.
Anyway, they think the cabin is the safest place.
We can&#8217;t do anything now, so let&#8217;s go back and
hit the hay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back, Gus to throw himself on old
Dan&#8217;s couch and sleep like a dead man and Bill
to take up the receiver phones, nodding over the
table, to be sure, but remaining generally awake.
For two hours he kept catching odd bits of no
importance through long intervals. Then suddenly
he sat up and, reaching over, poked Gus
with his crutch. After two or three hard pokes
Gus opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, somebody&#8217;s calling for help! I can&#8217;t get
it right, I reckon they&#8217;ve taken Tony away and
out to sea again. Can&#8217;t tell who it&#8217;s from; it&#8217;s
all jumbled, anyway. Done now, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what was it?&#8221; asked Gus, now very wide
awake.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It came like this, in code,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;The
&#8216;S.O.S.&#8217; several times. Then: &#8216;Aground. Rounding
inlet, east channel, headed out. Hurry.&#8217;
There was a lot of stuff in between, but not intelligible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be Tony?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But would they let him broadcast anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gave them the slip, maybe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;rounding east channel of inlet,
eh? Tide going out. Likely they&#8217;ll stick on the
shoals. If only Dan were here now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;d take his catboat and overhaul them.
They&#8217;ll probably stick going about and the wind&#8217;s
dead against going out. But Dan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t here, but I am. I&#8217;ll go forward with
the gun and you can handle the <i>Stella</i>. Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went. It was but the work of a few minutes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
to gain the landing, hoist sail, cast off and
reach down the bay, the wind abeam. Bill got
into a snug place at the mast, Gus held the tiller,
each boy firmly determined to do something that
might call for the utmost daring and swift action.
</p>
<p>Turning into the wind at the inlet, the boys
went about first on the starboard tack and then
luffed a half dozen times to get through into the
broader water; but the sand bars were erratic.
Gus knew two that were fixed from the set currents;
other might change every few days. Bill
crept to the rail and gazed ahead; there had been
a moon, but it was cloudy.
</p>
<p>Fortune favored them, however. At the moment
that they were about to hit a narrow sand
bar, the clouds parted and Bill gave a yell. Gus
also saw the line of white and shoved over his
tiller, missing the bar by the closest margin. In
deep water again they swept across the inlet as
the clouds darkened the moon and they were suddenly
confronted by a splotch of white. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
swerved once more just in time to avoid striking
the stern of a small schooner fast on a bar, only
her jib flapping in the breeze, not a light showing.
</p>
<p>Gus put the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> head into the wind and
close-hauled the boom, but she fell away slowly.
He told Bill to hail, which was done with a truly
sailor-like &#8220;Ahoy!&#8221; repeated many times, and
followed by the landlubber&#8217;s &#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; but
without getting an answer. Gus had to work
around to get the wind so as to come up again.
Still there was no reply to the hailing, and without
more ado the <i>Stella</i> was put alongside of the
schooner, going also aground, but lightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You grapple and hold her, Bill. I&#8217;ll board
her and see what&#8217;s what,&#8221; said Gus, pistol in hand,
stepping over the schooner&#8217;s rail.
</p>
<p>Swiftly, without hesitation, he rounded the
cabin, peered down the small companion-way and
shouted into the cabin, door, calling loudly. Then
he went back, got the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> lantern, and Bill,
having made fast, limped along after, gun in hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
The two silently explored every nook and cranny
finding, to their utter astonishment, no one aboard.
The door to one of the staterooms, however, was
fastened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if somebody is in there,&#8221; whispered
Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be. Looks funny. Let&#8217;s call,&#8221; Bill suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better beat it and mind our own
business,&#8221; said Gus, loudly. &#8220;Come on, we don&#8217;t
belong here at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Had the boys been suddenly confronted with a
genie, at the behest of Aladdin&#8217;s lamp, their surprise
could not have been much greater than at
the response from within the room. It was a girl&#8217;s
voice that reached them, and though very sweet
and low it was full of trepidation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you. What can you be plotting now?
If you intend to kill me you will have to destroy
this boat to do it, for I&#8217;ll surely kill you if you
try to break in here. Now, you&#8217;d better listen to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
me again. Sail back and I&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;re not
arrested and&mdash;I&#8217;ll get you a reward. You will
only get into jail by this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess, Miss, you&#8217;re talking to the wrong
party,&#8221; said Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaking us for somebody else,&#8221; asserted
Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, who are you, then?&#8221; came the voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two fellows at your service. We got a radio
at Oysterman Dan&#8217;s and thought we could rescue&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent it. I got to the wireless when they
were working to get us off. But please tell me
exactly who you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are Marshallton Tech boys, down here on
vacation,&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are? We know the professor of political
economy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennings? He&#8217;s one of our favorites&mdash;fine
chap.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that was where that boy was kidnaped,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same. He never turned up.&#8221; Bill
nudged Gus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago I was at Guilford and saw the
ball game with Marshallton Tech,&#8221; said the voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray! Right out here with me is the
pitcher who won that shut-out for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Do you really mean it? And then it was
you who hailed and came aboard just now, and
the others have not returned? I can trust you,
can&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? We&#8217;re really harmless. But tell
us who are these fellows?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, except that they are scoundrels
and thieves,&mdash;of that I am sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door suddenly opened and a figure stood
before the boys, something white, glistening and
menacing in her hand. An arm was outstretched
to turn a switch. With the flooding light Bill
and Gus beheld a very pretty girl of about their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
own age, who smiled at them and hastily held the
revolver behind her. Reassured, she calmly continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Lucy Waring. May I ask&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My chum here is Gus Grier and I am Bill
Brown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be indebted to you forever,&#8221; the girl
said graciously. &#8220;You see I am in an awful fix.
Those men deliberately stole our boat. This is
my father&#8217;s auxiliary yacht, the <i>X-Ray</i>. My
father is Doctor Louis Waring, of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The great Doctor Waring, nerve specialist?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nerves, yes. I believe people call him great
sometimes. You see we have a summer home at
Hawk&#8217;s Bill, just below the inlet here, and we
girls, my two sisters and some friends are there
now. Father and Mother are coming down to-morrow.
I&#8217;m fond of boating, and sometimes,
just to be on the water, I come down and sleep in
the yacht. To-night I did and I waked up to feel
that we were adrift and sailing, with somebody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
on board&mdash;two, I think. While I was wondering
what to do, one came and tried my door and called
to me, I said something to him, you may believe!
But he would hardly listen to me, though he
couldn&#8217;t force the door and I told him I&#8217;d shoot
if he did. Presently we went aground and the
men went back and started to work with the motor.
I slipped out and got at the wireless, locking my
door after me and locking the wireless room door.
I don&#8217;t know how they didn&#8217;t hear me, though
they were making an awful racket trying to hammer
something. I sent several messages, then I
listened and still heard them talking and slipped
back. They couldn&#8217;t get the engine to run&mdash;it can
hardly be cranked, but it has a starter which they
didn&#8217;t understand. About half an hour ago they
went off in the dory and I thought they were returning
when you came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have no idea who they are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever. I only know that the talk
of the one that called to me sounded as though he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
were a foreigner, perhaps an Italian&mdash;about the
other I couldn&#8217;t say. They surely meant to steal
this boat, and if they had not stuck here, I don&#8217;t
know whatever would have become of me. And
now, may I ask of you to&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Start that motor and get you back? You
sure may&mdash;and it ought not to be much of a job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My father will liberally reward you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any reward, Miss Waring.
Doing mechanical stunts in trying to rescue people
is our specialty.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>UNDER FIRE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I have a hunch,&#8221; put in Gus, &#8220;that those fellows
may come back any minute, possibly with
some means, or hoping to get this boat afloat.
We don&#8217;t want them to catch us off guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand watch,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;The slightest
intimation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Let&#8217;s look at that power plant,&#8221; demanded
Bill.
</p>
<p>It was a matter of minutes only, although the
time was lengthened by the boat thieves&#8217; having
hammered the gearing that connected with the
starter, trying to slide it along on its shaft key in
order to permit the cranking. They had failed
in some way, however, to manipulate the gas and
spark.
</p>
<p>The boys had slipped the gearing into place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
again and the adjustments had been made, when
a call from the girl made the busy lads grab their
weapons and get up on deck, Bill being almost as
quick as Gus.
</p>
<p>Not fifty yards away and plainly seen in the
now unclouded moonlight, a skiff was approaching.
The boys, lying flat on the deck and peering
over the rail, and the girl, crouching in the companion-way,
could see three persons in the dory.
Gus again told Bill to hail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, there! Back water and stay where you
are! What do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rhythmic beat of the oars continued, rapidly
lessening the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt, or we&#8217;ll shoot! If you don&#8217;t want to get
sunk and have your carcasses filled as full of holes
as a pepper-box, you&#8217;ll sheer off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This had its effect. The oars were held and
pushed to check the motion. No word came in
reply, but Gus plainly saw an object that resembled
a gun barrel come from a vertical to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
foreshortened position. This was sufficient for drastic
action, though the boy was averse to compelling
a tragedy. With careful aim he sent a load
of shot just over the heads of the boatmen, then
instantly fired another into the water at one side.
Almost immediately a shot came in reply, the
bullet glancing from the cabin roof.
</p>
<p>Gus slipped in two more shells and coolly
waited, knowing that there was only a remote possibility
that the shots from the dory would do
any great harm, but intending, if the rascals fired
again, to give them a real taste of buckshot firing,
at the bow of their boat first, to splinter and sink
it gradually; then at the men if they persisted.
</p>
<p>The dory turned about quickly. The oarsman
was evidently in haste to get away. Then came
a hail:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you! What you do in thata boat? That
our boat! Get out, I say to you! We want to
come aboard and go on away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gus had heard that voice before. It belonged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
to one of the Malatesta. Did they have Tony
with them? Were they making a terrible effort
to escape in this way from the peninsula, and get
to sea again? How then would they secure the
hoped for ransom? Or were they merely going
to hide the <i>X-Ray</i>, expecting to use her if their
scheme fell short? Bill had sensed the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Your</i> boat, is she? You&#8217;ll find her back at
Hawk&#8217;s Bill where she belongs, and in a little
while you&#8217;re going to find yourself in jail. Beat
it now while the water&#8217;s fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The oarsman was nothing loath. Either he was
not the bravest in the party, or else he had the
keenest appreciation of the odds against an exposed
position. In a very few minutes the dory
was a mere gray wraith on the water, but there it
hung. Evidently the rower was overruled by
others less cautious, or of the certain conviction
that at the distance the yacht was a better mark
than a rowboat.
</p>
<p>Bill had the motor going in a jiffy. Gus was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
at the wheel, crouching. Throwing in the reverse
clutch he sent the boat off the sands. Then, letting
Bill hold her steady, dropped the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i>
sails, cast her loose at the end of a hauser for a
tow rope, paid it out from the stern and went back
to the wheel.
</p>
<p>He was about to swing round and head back
into the narrow channel free from sand bars,
which he could discern by the rougher water,
when bullets began to come from the dory. They
were aimed at the wheel and whether sent low
or not, the trajectory, even from a high-powered
gun, would pull them down to the danger level.
One struck the mast directly in front of him. One
hit the deck and glanced singing. The music
from another flattened bullet was stopped by the
water beyond.
</p>
<p>Gus wanted desperately to get behind something,
for this firing might mean death or wounding
at any moment. But he held on, hoping
shortly to get out of range. Bill, at the rear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
hatch, called to Gus to set her and come below,
and Gus called back that they&#8217;d be aground again
in a minute if he did. Then a brave deed was
done.
</p>
<p>The girl, perhaps as fully aware of the danger
as the boys, leaped into the cabin, came out with
two chairs and some cushions, erected a barricade
alongside of Gus and said to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get back and we can&#8217;t stop, but most
of all I want you to be safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she gave a sudden cry and staggered into
the cabin. Gus called Bill, who limped across
quickly. The shots continued, and one hit the
chairs. Gus wondered where it would have hit
him. Presently they were too far away for the
shots to reach them, for they had entered the
narrow bay.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER SCHEME</h3>
</div>

<p>Bill was not cut out for a nurse. His sympathies
were large, but his fingers, deft at managing
fine mechanical apparatus, were all thumbs
when it came to anything even remotely concerned
with human anatomy. The girl had been hit in
the shoulder, undoubtedly a mere flesh wound,
and the bleeding must be stopped. Lucy was
very pale, but there was never a tear, nor the least
indication of her fainting. She merely held her
arm down and watched, with most rueful countenance,
the blood dripping from her finger tips
upon the polished floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get Gus,&#8221; said Bill, almost ready to weep
at the sight the girl presented. She had torn her
dress from her shoulder and a seared gash was
disclosed which she could not well observe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>Gus pointed out the course to Bill, then went
into the cabin. In a minute or less he had
searched and obtained clean rags, torn strips
from them, found a nearly exhausted bottle of
vaseline, coated the rag with it and, with a deftness
almost worthy of a surgeon, washed the
wound with a quick sopping of gasoline. Then as
more blood was flowing, he bound up the shoulder
and arm so that the flow stopped and by its coagulation
germs were excluded. Whereupon Lucy
sought a couch where she lay, exhausted, and with
a decided desire to cry, while Gus went back to
the wheel.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;You shall hear from father and mother and
all of us. They will be here early and father
must see you.&#8221; This was the very earnest declaration
of the elder Waring sister, a young
woman of twenty-five or more, &#8220;I cannot alone
express our thanks, our deep gratitude&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To use a rather slangy expression&mdash;please
&#8216;forget it,&#8217;&#8221; said Bill, laughing.
</p>
<p>Lucy, supported by another older sister, could
only thank the boys with her pretty eyes. She
did make so bold as to hold the hand of poor Gus
until he turned a fiery red. Blushing herself,
even through her pallor, she still persisted in trying
to show her appreciation and admiration.
Bill had to grab and pull his stammering chum
away.
</p>
<p>The run back in the <i>Stella</i> was made in rapid
time to her owner&#8217;s slip. And there, the morning
light just beginning to show in the eastern sky,
the boys found an odd-looking fellow busily getting
ready to cast off a fishing skiff. He was one
Pepperman, commonly called &#8220;Swamp&#8221; for
short. He was something of a crony of Dan&#8217;s and
the boys had seen him before.
</p>
<p>As they headed in they made out the identity
of &#8220;Swamp.&#8221; Gus suddenly had one of his ideas.
He conveyed it to Bill in few words:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get &#8216;Swamp&#8217; to go to those Malatestas
and tell them he can steal them a boat. Then
we&#8217;ll get Tony away if he&#8217;s still there. You talk
to &#8216;Swamp.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Pepperman! Going fishing?&#8221;
began Bill, as they made fast and lowered sail.
&#8220;Yes? Expect to catch much? No? Well, I
know something that will bring you in two hours
more money than in three weeks of the best fishing
you ever had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Swamp&#8221; wanted to know how such a thing
could be done. Said Bill:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead easy! You take a walk right away down
through the pines toward the Point. Know how
to whistle a tune? Sure; well then, come over all
the tunes you know. Let on you&#8217;re hunting for
special fish bait or something. Sheer off toward
the big pine and keep through toward the ocean.
You&#8217;ll meet somebody likely. Don&#8217;t get curious,
but talk fishing and boats. Tell them you take
folks fishing and that you have a dandy boat all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
ready&mdash;a fast one. They&#8217;ll probably want to see
her. Tell them you keep her up here, but if they&#8217;ll
hang off shore at the Point you&#8217;ll sail her around
there. Then, when they leave for the Point and
you&#8217;re sure of it, you come up the bay side road
and tell us. We&#8217;ll be waiting. How much is there
in it? Twenty-five dollars, Mr. Pepperman, if
your errand turns out successfully. Is that
enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon hit air,&#8221; remarked the sententious
&#8220;Swamp.&#8221; &#8220;When do I git the money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time&mdash;to-day,&#8221; said Gus, and without another
word the lanky fellow, laying aside his
tackle and bait of crab meat, was off into the
woods.
</p>
<p>Hardly an hour passed before Gus remarked
to tired and sleepy Bill: &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s coming.
I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s &#8216;Swamp.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, and he reported the exact carrying out
of the plan. Two men, young fellows, one very
dark-skinned, the other light, and both carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
guns, had started to the Point to wait for him.
The other man,&mdash;there had been three along the
wood road&mdash;had headed up into the nearer woods
along the ocean side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go back and wait for Dan,&#8221; said Gus to
Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make one more try for
Tony.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>AT THE CRACK O&#8217; DAY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Tony!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no reply. Gus called again, more
sharply, but still fearful of being heard. Silence.
There could be no delay in action. With his
nerves still a-tingle, the boy seized a stout bit of
wood, evidently cut for the fireplace, inserted it
between the window bars, bore down and with a
low squeak of protest the nails came out. Another
pry, with the sill for a fulcrum, and there
was a hole big enough for a body to get through.
The bit of wood now acted as a step and in a moment
Gus was inside the cabin.
</p>
<p>At the extreme end, lying against the logs, lay
a figure. Gus instantly stooped to shake it.
Tony waked up with a cry of alarm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t yell, Tony, it&#8217;s Gus! Get up and
come quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing more was required of Tony. He was
instantly awake and in action. Not another word
passed between the boys&mdash;but was that cry heard
by the kidnapers?&mdash;the rescuer wondered&mdash;and
with reason. They must be off instantly.
</p>
<p>To the window! As Tony drew near it, pulling
Gus by the hand across the dark room, he
paused. Outside there was the faint sound of a
step. Tony uttered a faint &#8220;sh,&#8221; and grabbed
Gus by the arm. It was the elder Malatesta.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! So? You make get-away. I fix that.&#8221;
The next instant the muzzle of a rifle was poked
through the broken place&mdash;poked well through,
and possibly this shrewd defier of law and order
never made a greater mistake, which he recognized
when he felt the muzzle seized and bent
aside.
</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger, but the bullet buried itself
harmlessly in the wall of the cabin. Malatesta
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
attempted to jerk the gun away, but Gus, fortified
by the leverage against the sill and the window
bars, held on, his own weapon crashing to the floor.
How Tony managed to dive through that hole as
he did, landing squarely on his enemy neither
he nor Gus ever could figure out, but when Gus
found the weapon free in his hands, picked up his
own gun and followed Tony he found the insensible
miscreant, who had received a sufficient smash
in the jaw from Tony&#8217;s heel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must fly, my dear friend Gus,&#8221; said Tony,
&#8220;for now they will come&mdash;those other two!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will stay right here and give them a pleasant
reception,&#8221; said Gus. &#8220;I will watch on the
path, Tony. You take this gun. But first get a
rope, quick! Tie that chap&#8217;s arms behind him
and search him for automatics, or anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was but the work of a few minutes. Malatesta
seemed to hesitate about coming to his
senses. This was a good thing for the success
of the subsequent capture; for the elder brother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
might have called out and warned his two confederates.
</p>
<p>Gus told Tony to guard the far side of the cabin
and arranged that either must come at the call of
the other. They must shoot only when sure.
</p>
<p>Back came the younger Malatesta, their better
known enemy. From behind a bush Gus poked
his shotgun muzzle into the fellow&#8217;s ribs, told
him to drop his rifle and stick up his hands. As
he did this, he uttered a frantic yell of warning.
Then he, too, was seized and bound.
</p>
<p>They waited long and eagerly for the American
accomplice. Would he sneak through the woods
and try to surprise them? To guard against this,
Gus left Tony with the two prisoners, thus reversing
the conditions under which he had lately
been held. There was no glee, no revengeful
spirit shown by the fine-minded Italian youth, but
a keen sense of satisfaction and determination
glowed in his eyes.
</p>
<p>Gus scoured the woods, hoping to find the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
accomplice, who would not recognize him as an
enemy. But the fellow was gone. It was an easy
thing for him to hide there&mdash;but not so easy to get
away altogether, past the cordon of police now
swarming over the peninsula. But he did get
away, for he was never heard of again.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>MORE MESSAGES</h3>
</div>

<p>Oysterman Dan&#8217;s little cottage became the
scene of more than a reunion of old friends and
of glad father and son. The news reporters also
came, and, somewhat to his disgust, old Dan had
to submit to his &#8220;pixture bein&#8217; took,&#8221; along with
the banker, Bill, Gus, Tony, and some of the insistent
police and detectives who are often too
eager for notoriety.
</p>
<p>The Malatesta brothers, too, were not forgotten.
Before they were taken off to a well deserved
imprisonment, they were pictured and thus
indelibly branded. Later they were returned to
their native country.
</p>
<p>All this business having been accomplished and
Oysterman Dan rewarded utterly beyond his
imagination, Mr. Sabaste took command with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
lavish hand, and the return of the four principals,
by yacht and motor car, became a gala affair.
Bill and Gus refused beyond parley to accept
the reward Mr. Sabaste had offered. What
the boys had done was in friendship only. Expenses?
The banker had the say as to that.
</p>
<p>Tony, in spite of his long imprisonment, was
speedily restored to his happy, kindly state of
mind. A long, roundabout trip took them all back
to the Marshallton Tech where the late unfortunate
could again outfit himself from an ample
wardrobe, while Bill and Gus restored, with the
janitor&#8217;s knowledge, the radio transmitting set
and the portable receiver. A new receiving set
was to be completed soon and set up for Oysterman
Dan.
</p>
<p>The Farrells were visited; Tony went to the
room he had occupied, but he could not remember
a thing that had occurred there in connection with
his mysterious disappearance. The farmer&#8217;s
wife and daughter set them all down to a good,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
old-fashioned American dinner that the Sabastes
laughingly declared did not need spaghetti to
make it perfect.
</p>
<p>Then, at the school again, the banker requested
the use once more of the radio transmitter. Bill
sat, listening in. Gus and Tony stood in the doorway,
talking of school days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Angelo Sabaste speaking. I wish especially
to convey a message to my old friend
Guglielmo Marconi, on his yacht, the <i>Elettra</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then followed many words in Italian, interspersed
only here and there with an American
proper name.
</p>
<p>At the end of the message there was the usual
pause. The banker took up the phones, Gus and
Tony rushed to others. Presently they heard, in
quiet, even tones, the hoped-for reply in English,
as Mr. Sabaste had requested it should be:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senatore Marconi sends congratulations to
Signor Sabaste that his son is restored to him
and that two criminals, though they are our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
countrymen, are to be sent from America, where
too many such have come and belittled the name
of Italy. But men like Signor Sabaste will lift
that estimate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senatore Marconi suggests, at your request,
that the finest reward that could come to these
young Americans who have shown such loyalty
to your son, with such ingenuity and mechanical
ability, is that they be encouraged to complete
their technical education and then, with your son,
to use their talents in a commercial way. Again
congratulations for your son and those young
Americans and&mdash;the best of success!&#8221;
</p>
<p>How Mr. Sabaste, eager to carry out this suggestion
from the famous inventor of wireless
communication, joined with the boys&#8217; old friend
Mr. Hooper in the establishment of a company in
mechanical and electrical engineering, under the
name of The Loyalty Company, will be told in
&#8220;Bill Brown, Radio Wizard.&#8221;
